(3) a certified or authenticated copy of a record or report of a governmental agency, domestic or foreign, that an individual is missing, detained, dead, or alive is prima facie evidence of the status and of the dates, circumstances, and places disclosed by the record or report;
(4) in the absence of prima facie evidence of death under (2) or (3) of this section, the fact of death may be established by clear and convincing evidence, including circumstantial evidence;
(5) an individual whose death is not established under (1)  (4) of this section and who is absent for a continuous period of five years, during which the individual has not been heard from, and whose absence is not satisfactorily explained after diligent search or inquiry, is presumed to be dead; the individual's death is presumed to have occurred at the end of the period unless there is sufficient evidence for determining that death occurred earlier;
(6) in the absence of evidence disputing the time of death stated on a document described in (2) or (3) of this section, a document described in (2) or (3) of this section that states a time of death 120 hours or more after the time of death of another individual, however the time of death of the other individual is determined, establishes by clear and convincing evidence that the individual survived the other individual by at least 120 hours.</p>
