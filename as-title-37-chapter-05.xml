              <p>Sec. 37.05.035.   Annual state loan reports.
Each state agency that makes or purchases a loan shall prepare an annual report of the aggregate of all loans, by type, made or purchased by the state agency during the preceding fiscal year. The report must include the estimated rate of interest that would have been charged if the loan had been made or purchased at prevailing market rates and must include the difference between the return on the loan that would have been realized under that estimated rate of interest and the return on the loans under the interest rate actually charged. In the absence of a prevailing market rate in the state, the state agency shall use a rate that, in the judgment of the agency, is comparable to a prevailing market rate. The report must also include an analysis of the income groups benefited under the loan programs. By January 30 of each year the state agency shall notify the legislature that the report prepared under this section is available.</p>
