              <p>Sec. 12.55.005.   Declaration of purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to provide the means for determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed upon conviction of an offense. The legislature finds that the elimination of unjustified disparity in sentences and the attainment of reasonable uniformity in sentences can best be achieved through a sentencing framework fixed by statute as provided in this chapter. In imposing sentence, the court shall consider
(1) the seriousness of the defendant's present offense in relation to other offenses;
(2) the prior criminal history of the defendant and the likelihood of rehabilitation;
(3) the need to confine the defendant to prevent further harm to the public;
(4) the circumstances of the offense and the extent to which the offense harmed the victim or endangered the public safety or order;
(5) the effect of the sentence to be imposed in deterring the defendant or other members of society from future criminal conduct;
(6) the effect of the sentence to be imposed as a community condemnation of the criminal act and as a reaffirmation of societal norms; and
(7) the restoration of the victim and the community.</p>

                <p>A court, when considering the sentence to be imposed under this chapter for an offense other than a violation of
AS 11.41
,
AS 11.46.400
, or a crime involving domestic violence, may permit the victim and the offender to submit a sentence for the court's review based upon a negotiated agreement between the victim and the offender, or between the offender and the community if there is no victim. The court may, with the consent of the victim and the offender, impose the sentence that has been determined by the negotiated agreement between the offender and the victim, or between the offender and the community if there is no victim, if that sentence otherwise complies with this chapter and accomplishes the goals of restoration of the victim and the community and rehabilitation of the offender. Before accepting a negotiated agreement, the court shall determine that the victim has not been intimidated or coerced in reaching the agreement. In this section, community has the meaning determined by the court.</p>

                <p>If the defendant defaults in the payment of a fine or any installment or of restitution or any installment, the court may order the defendant to show cause why the defendant should not be sentenced to imprisonment for nonpayment and, if the payment was made a condition of the defendant's probation, may revoke the probation of the defendant. In a contempt or probation revocation proceeding brought as a result of failure to pay a fine or restitution, it is an affirmative defense that the defendant was unable to pay despite having made continuing good faith efforts to pay the fine or restitution. If the court finds that the defendant was unable to pay despite having made continuing good faith efforts, the defendant may not be imprisoned solely because of the inability to pay. If the court does not find that the default was attributable to the defendant's inability to pay despite having made continuing good faith efforts to pay the fine or restitution, the court may order the defendant imprisoned until the order of the court is satisfied. A term of imprisonment imposed under this section may not exceed one day for each $50 of the unpaid portion of the fine or restitution or one year, whichever is shorter. Credit shall be given toward satisfaction of the order of the court for every day a person is incarcerated for nonpayment of a fine or restitution.</p>

The court may reduce the fine ordered, change the payment schedule, or otherwise modify the order. The court may not reduce an order of restitution but may change the payment schedule.</p>

                <p>A sentence of imprisonment lawfully imposed by the superior court for a term or for aggregate terms exceeding two years of unsuspended incarceration for a felony offense or exceeding 120 days for a misdemeanor offense may be appealed to the court of appeals by the defendant on the ground that the sentence is excessive, unless the sentence was imposed in accordance with a plea agreement under the applicable Alaska Rules of Criminal Procedure and that agreement provided for imposition of a specific sentence or a sentence equal to or less than a specified maximum sentence. If the superior court imposed a sentence in accordance with a plea agreement that provided for a minimum sentence, the defendant may appeal only that portion of the sentence that exceeds the minimum sentence provided for in the plea agreement and that exceeds two years of unsuspended incarceration for a felony offense or 120 days of unsuspended incarceration for a misdemeanor offense. By appealing a sentence under this section, the defendant waives the right to plead that by a revision of the sentence resulting from the appeal the defendant has been twice placed in jeopardy for the same offense.</p>
