                <p>A health maintenance organization shall file a notice and adequate supporting information with the director before the exercise of a power granted in (a)(1), (2), or (4) of this section.  The director may disapprove the exercise of a power only if, in the director's opinion, it would substantially and adversely affect the financial soundness of the health maintenance organization and endanger its ability to meet its obligations.  If the director does not disapprove the exercise of power within 30 days after the filing of the notice, it is considered approved.  The director may adopt regulations exempting from the filing requirement of this section those activities having a minimal effect on the health maintenance organization.</p>

              <p>Sec. 21.86.110.   Recovery of health care costs.
If a health maintenance organization determines that an enrollee has received health care services that the enrollee is not entitled to receive under the terms of the health maintenance agreement, the organization may not recover an amount above the actual cost of providing the health care service. This section does not apply if the enrollee gave or withheld information to the health maintenance organization with the intent to mislead or misinform the organization as to the enrollee's right to receive the health care services.</p>
