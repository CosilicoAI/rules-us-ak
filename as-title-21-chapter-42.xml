              <p>Sec. 21.42.270.   Assignment of policies.
A policy may be assignable or nonassignable, depending upon its terms. Subject to its terms relating to its assignability, a life, group life, or health insurance policy, whether issued before or after July 1, 1966, under the terms of which the beneficiary may be changed upon the sole request of the insured, may be assigned either by pledge or transfer of title by an assignment executed by the insured alone and delivered to the insurer, whether or not the pledgee or assignee is the insurer. The assignment entitles the insurer to deal with the assignee as the owner or pledgee of the policy in accordance with the terms of the assignment until the insurer has received at its home office written notice of termination of the assignment or pledge, or written notice by or on behalf of some other person claiming an interest in the policy that is in conflict with the assignment.</p>

When the proceeds of or payments under a life or health insurance policy or annuity contract, whether issued before or after July 1, 1966, become payable in accordance with the terms of the policy or contract, or the exercise of a right or privilege under the policy or contract and the insurer makes payment in accordance with the terms of the policy or contract or in accordance with a written assignment, the person then designated under the policy as being entitled to the proceeds or payments shall be entitled to receive the proceeds or payments and to give full acquittance for them. The payments shall fully discharge the insurer from all claims under the policy or contract unless, before payment is made, the insurer has received at its home office written notice by or on behalf of another person that the other person claims to be entitled to the payment or some interest in the policy or contract.</p>
