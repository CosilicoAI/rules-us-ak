            <content>
              <p>Sec. 16.05.052.   Nuisance moose.
The department shall avoid destruction of nuisance moose if a practicable alternative exists for the relocation of the moose to suitable habitat where the moose will not be a nuisance. The commissioner may authorize one or more private individuals or groups to relocate nuisance moose to suitable habitat designated by the department if, upon review and evaluation of a written application and proposal, the commissioner finds that the individual or group is qualified to relocate nuisance moose without undue danger to the public, themselves, or the moose. Before relocating nuisance moose, an authorized individual or group shall provide financial assurances acceptable to the commissioner that will cover the state's reasonable anticipated costs of the relocation and indemnify the state for liability for damages to private persons and property arising from the actions of the individual or group in relocating nuisance moose under this section. The authorized individual or group shall reimburse the state for its costs that arise from relocating nuisance moose. A civil action to recover damages or costs that arise from relocating nuisance moose may not be brought against the state or a political subdivision, officer, or employee of the state. If darts containing narcotics are used to tranquilize moose, all of the darts shall be recovered and properly disposed. In this section, nuisance moose means moose designated by the department in an area of concentrated human population that pose a significant risk to the health, safety, or economic well-being of persons in the area.</p>

            <content>
              <p>Sec. 16.05.380.   Commissioner may appoint agents.
The commissioner may appoint state employees or other persons to take applications, issue licenses, permits, and tags, and collect fees. The commissioner is not liable for defalcation or failure to account for the fees collected by any person so appointed, but the commissioner shall require a bond in an adequate sum, conditioned upon faithfully accounting for all money collected. However, the commissioner may waive the bond requirements of an instrumentality of the United States or its agents and employees when the instrumentality or its agents or employees sell licenses, permits, or tags primarily to persons in the armed forces. Each person, upon appointment by the commissioner, may administer oaths on applications for licenses, permits, and tags.</p>

The possession of fish or game or a part of fish or game, or a nest or egg of a bird during the time the taking of it is prohibited is prima facie evidence that it was taken, possessed, bought, or sold or transported in violation of this chapter.  The burden of proof is upon the possessor or claimant of it to overcome the presumption of illegal possession and to establish the fact that it was obtained and is possessed lawfully.  This section does not apply
(1) during the first full 10 days after the time when a taking is prohibited, except as provided in (3) of this section;
(2) if the fish or game or part of fish or game is in a preserved condition whether frozen, smoked, canned, salted, pickled, or otherwise preserved; or
(3) with respect to crab aboard a commercial crab fishing vessel, during the first full three days after the time when a taking is prohibited.</p>
