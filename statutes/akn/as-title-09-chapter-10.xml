              <p>Sec. 09.10.230.   Certain actions relating to real property.
A person may not bring an action for the determination of a right or claim to or interest in real property unless commenced within the limitations provided for actions for the recovery of the possession of real property.  However, a person may not bring an action to set aside, cancel, annul, or otherwise affect a patent to land issued by this state or the United States, or to compel a person claiming or holding under a patent to convey the land described in the patent or a portion of the land to the plaintiff in the action, or to hold the land in trust for or to the use and benefit of the plaintiff, or on account of any matter, thing, or transaction that was had, done, suffered, or transpired before the date of the patent unless the action is commenced within 10 years from the date of the patent. In an action upon a new promise, fraud, or mistake, the running of the time within which an action may be commenced starts from the making of the new promise or the discovery of the fraud or mistake. This section does not bar an equitable owner in possession of real property from defending possession by means of the equitable title. The right of an equitable owner to defend possession in an action or by complaint for injunction is not barred by lapse of time while an action for the possession of the real property is not barred by the provisions of this chapter.</p>
