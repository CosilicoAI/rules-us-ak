When the department has reason to believe that an applicant or licensee has been guilty of any of the following acts or omissions, it may conduct an investigation, and the department may, after proper hearing and notice in accordance with
AS 44.62
(Administrative Procedure Act), refuse to issue, refuse to renew, or may suspend or revoke, a license upon a finding by the department of any of the following acts or omissions:
(1) fraud or misrepresentation in obtaining a license;
(2) misrepresentation or fraud in the practice of mortuary science;
(3) false or misleading advertising;
(4) aiding or abetting an unlicensed person to practice mortuary science;
(5) using a casket or part of a casket which has previously been used as a receptacle for the burial or other final disposition of another dead human body;
(6) refusing to promptly surrender the custody of a dead human body upon the order of the person lawfully entitled to custody;
(7) solicitation of a dead human body by the licensee, the licensee's agents, servants or employees, if solicitation occurs after death, or while death is impending but this does not prohibit advertising or sales made on a pre-need basis;
(8) employment by the licensee of any person for the purpose of calling upon individuals or institutions to influence them to turn over a dead human body to a particular licensee immediately before an impending death or after death;
(9) the direct or indirect payment or offer of payment for the purpose of obtaining a dead body by the licensee, the licensee's agents, servants or employees immediately before an impending death or after death;
(10) immediately before impending death or after death, solicitation or acceptance by a licensee of any payment for recommending or causing a dead human body to be disposed of in a specific crematory, mausoleum or cemetery; however, this section does not prevent the recommendation or solicitation for sales of space and merchandise in a specific crematory, mausoleum or cemetery, if the licensee has an ownership interest in the specific crematory, mausoleum or cemetery and the ownership interest is disclosed at the time of the solicitation, recommendation or sale;
(11) violation of a state law or regulation or municipal ordinance or regulation or federal law or regulation affecting the disposition of a dead human body, or contracts relating to the disposition of a dead human body;
(12) violation of any of the provisions of this chapter;

              <p>Sec. 08.42.100.   Funeral establishment permit.
A person may not conduct, maintain, manage, or operate a funeral establishment unless a permit for each establishment has been issued by the department and is conspicuously displayed in the funeral establishment. Each permit is valid only for one specific location, and each firm operating from the same funeral establishment shall obtain a separate permit. The department shall issue a permit to operate a funeral establishment upon application for the permit on a form provided by the department. All permits expire at the time established under
AS 08.01.100
and may be renewed for successive terms. Violation of a provision of
AS 08.42.090
by a person operating a funeral establishment or, with that person's knowledge or consent, by an employee is considered sufficient cause for suspension or revocation of the funeral establishment permit.</p>
