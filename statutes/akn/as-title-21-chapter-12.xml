The director may, by regulation adopted under (g)(2) of this section, specify additional requirements relating to, or setting out, the valuation of assets or reserve credits, the amount and forms of security supporting reinsurance arrangements described in (g)(2) of this section, and the circumstances under which credit will be reduced or eliminated. Credit is allowed under (1)  (3) of this subsection with respect to cessions of a kind or class of business that the assuming insurer is licensed or permitted to write or assume in its state of domicile or, in the case of a United States branch of an alien assuming insurer, in the state through which it is entered and licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance. Credit is allowed under (3) or (4) of this subsection only if the applicable requirements in (b) of this section have been satisfied.
