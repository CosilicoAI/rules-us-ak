In case of default in the payment of an installment or call when payment is due, the corporation may proceed to collect the amount due as any debt due the corporation. The bylaws may prescribe other remedies for failure to pay installments or calls that become due. No remedy working a forfeiture of a subscription, or of the amounts paid on a subscription, may be declared against a subscriber unless the amount due remains unpaid for a period of 20 days after written demand has been made. If mailed, written demand is considered to be made when it is deposited in the United States mail in a sealed envelope addressed to the subscriber at the last post office address known to the corporation, with postage prepaid. On a sale of shares by reason of forfeiture, the excess of proceeds realized over the amount due and unpaid on the shares shall be paid to the delinquent subscriber or to the legal representative of the subscriber.</p>

Subject to a provision in its articles, a corporation may create and issue, whether or not in connection with the issuance and sale of any of its shares or other securities, rights or options entitling the holders of the rights or options to purchase from the corporation shares of any class or classes. These rights or options shall be evidenced in the manner the board approves and, subject to the provisions of the articles, must set out the terms upon which, the time within which, and the price at which the shares may be purchased from the corporation upon the exercise of the right or option. If the rights or options are to be issued to directors, officers, or employees of the corporation or of a subsidiary of the corporation and not to the shareholders generally, their issuance shall be authorized by the approval of the outstanding shares or must be consistent with a plan so approved or ratified. In the absence of fraud in the transaction, the judgment of the board as to the adequacy of the consideration received for the rights or options is conclusive.</p>

                <p>A corporation may indemnify a person who was, is, or is threatened to be made a party to a completed, pending, or threatened action or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative, other than an action by or in the right of the corporation, by reason of the fact that the person is or was a director, officer, employee, or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise. Indemnification may include reimbursement of expenses, attorney fees, judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection with the action or proceeding if the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to a criminal action or proceeding, the person had no reasonable cause to believe the conduct was unlawful. The termination of an action or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, does not create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to a criminal action or proceeding, the person had reasonable cause to believe that the conduct was unlawful.</p>

                <p>A corporation may indemnify a person who was, is, or is threatened to be made a party to a completed, pending, or threatened action by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that the person is or was a director, officer, employee, or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise. Indemnification may include reimbursement for expenses and attorney fees actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection with the defense or settlement of the action if the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation. Indemnification may not be made in respect of any claim, issue, or matter as to which the person has been adjudged to be liable for negligence or misconduct in the performance of the person's duty to the corporation except to the extent that the court in which the action was brought determines upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability, in view of all the circumstances of the case, the person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for expenses that the court considers proper.</p>

              <p>Sec. 10.06.544.   Notice to and approval by shareholders.
Upon approval by the board of each corporation of a plan of merger, consolidation, or exchange, each board shall, by resolution, direct that the plan be submitted for approval, at either an annual or special meeting, by the outstanding shares of each corporation. Written notice shall be given to each shareholder of record, whether or not the share or shares of the shareholder have voting rights under the articles of the corporation, not less than 20 days before the meeting, in the manner provided in this chapter for the giving of notice of meetings of shareholders. Whether the meeting is an annual or special meeting, the notice shall state that the purpose or one of the purposes of the meeting is to consider the proposed plan of merger, consolidation, or exchange. A copy or summary of the plan of merger, consolidation, or exchange, as well as a copy of
AS 10.06.574
and 10.06.576, concerning the rights of a dissenting shareholder, shall be included with the notice.</p>

              <p>Sec. 10.06.546.   Manner of approval by shareholders.
At each meeting for which notice is given under
AS 10.06.544
a vote of the shareholders shall be taken on the proposed plan of merger, consolidation, or exchange. Each outstanding share of each corporation may vote on the proposed plan whether or not the share has voting rights under the articles of the corporation. The plan is approved if it receives the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of each corporation. If a class of shares of a corporation is entitled to vote on the plan as a class, the plan is approved if it receives the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of each class of shares entitled to vote on the plan as a class and the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the total shares entitled to vote on the plan. A class of shares of a corporation is entitled to vote as a class if a plan contains a provision that, if contained in a proposed amendment to the articles of incorporation, would entitle the class of shares to vote as a class and, in the case of an exchange, if the class is included in the exchange.</p>

A notice of election may be withdrawn by the shareholder at any time before an acceptance under
AS 10.06.578
(f), but in no case later than 60 days from the date of completion of the corporate action, except that the time for withdrawing a notice of election shall be extended for 60 days from the date an offer is made, if the corporation fails to make a timely offer under
AS 10.06.578
. After the time for withdrawal has expired, withdrawal of a notice of election requires the written consent of the corporation. In order to be effective, withdrawal of a notice of election must be accompanied by the return to the corporation of an advance payment made to the shareholder as provided in
AS 10.06.578
. If a notice of election is withdrawn, if the corporate action is rescinded, if a court determines that the shareholder is not entitled to the right to dissent, or if the shareholder otherwise loses the right to dissent, the shareholder shall not have the right to receive payment for the shares and shall be reinstated to all rights as a shareholder that were effective on the date of the completion of the corporate action. The rights to which the shareholder is reinstated include intervening preemptive rights and the right to payment of an intervening dividend or other distribution. If an intervening right has expired or if a dividend or distribution that is not in cash has been completed, the corporation may elect to pay the shareholder the fair value of the shares in cash at the value, as determined by the board, at the time of the expiration or completion. The election to pay the value in cash shall be without prejudice to a corporate proceeding that has occurred in the interim.</p>

The commissioner may, within one year after a filing, and after written notice to the corporation or individual making the filing, cancel a certificate issued or filing accepted under this chapter, on any ground existing at the time of issuance or filing for which the commissioner could have originally refused to issue the certificate or accept the filing. The notice of cancellation must state the reason for the cancellation. A corporation or individual may request a hearing conducted by the office of administrative hearings (

) within 90 days after receipt of the notice. Cancellation becomes final if the corporation or individual does not request a hearing within 90 days after receipt of notice. Notice of cancellation shall be sent by certified mail with return receipt requested. If the return receipt is not received by the department within a reasonable time and the department has made diligent inquiry as to the address of the corporation, notice may be made by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the vicinity of the registered office of the corporation or the address of the individual who made the filing, and the cancellation becomes final 60 days after publication of the notice if the person or corporation does not request a hearing.</p>
