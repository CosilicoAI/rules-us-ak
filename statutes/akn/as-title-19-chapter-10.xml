              <p>Sec. 19.10.010.   Dedication of land for public highways.
A tract 100 feet wide between each section of land owned by the state, or acquired from the state, and a tract four rods wide between all other sections in the state, is dedicated for use as public highways.  The section line is the center of the dedicated right-of-way.  If the highway is vacated, title to the strip inures to the owner of the tract of which it formed a part by the original survey.</p>

Requests for public bids are governed by

The contract for materials and supplies may be awarded either upon the basis of delivery to the construction project directly or to a central storehouse or storehouses maintained by the department.  Those materials and supplies so purchased by the department may be delivered to the project site without expense to the contractor, or it may sell them to the contractor at cost and make the materials and supplies a part of the construction cost.</p>
