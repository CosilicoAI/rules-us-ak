              <p>Sec. 14.18.010.   Discrimination based on sex and race prohibited.
Recognizing the benefit to the state and nation of equal educational opportunities for all students, and equal employment opportunity for public education employees, discrimination on the basis of sex against an employee or a student in public education in Alaska and discrimination against an employee on the basis of race violate art. I, § 3 of the Alaska Constitution and are prohibited.  A person in the state may not on the basis of sex be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal or state financial assistance.</p>
