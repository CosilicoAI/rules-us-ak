            <content>
              <p>Sec. 21.36.096.   Prohibited denial of claim for causation.
An insurer may not deny a claim if a risk, hazard, or contingency insured against is the dominant cause of a loss and the denial occurs because an excluded risk, hazard, or contingency is also in a chain of causes but operates on a secondary basis.</p>

              <p>Sec. 21.36.100.   Rebates.
Except as otherwise expressly provided by law, a person may not knowingly permit or offer to make or make a contract of life insurance, life annuity or health insurance, or agreement under the contract other than as plainly expressed in the contract, or pay, allow, give or offer to pay, allow, or give, directly or indirectly, as inducement to the insurance, or annuity, a rebate of premiums payable on the contract, or a special favor or advantage in the dividends or other benefits, or paid employment or contract for services of any kind, or any valuable consideration or inducement whatever not specified in the contract; or directly or indirectly give, sell, purchase or offer to agree to give, sell, purchase, or allow as inducement to the insurance or annuity or in connection therewith, whether or not to be specified in the policy or contract, an agreement of any form or nature promising returns, profits, stocks, bonds, or other securities, or interest present or contingent in the contract or as measured by the contract, of an insurance company or other corporation, association, or partnership, or dividends or profits accrued or to accrue under the contract; or offer, promise, or give anything of value that is not specified in the contract.</p>

              <p>Sec. 21.36.110.   Exceptions to discrimination and rebates.
Nothing in
AS 21.36.090
, 21.36.100, and
AS 21.54.100
may be construed as including within the definition of discrimination or rebates any of the following practices:
(1) in the case of a contract of life insurance or life annuity, paying bonuses to policyholders or otherwise abating their premiums in whole or in part out of surplus accumulated from nonparticipating insurance, if the bonuses or abatement of premiums is fair and equitable to policyholders and for the best interests of the insurer;
(2) in the case of a life insurance policy issued on industrial debit, preauthorized check, bank draft, or similar plans, making allowance to policyholders who have made premium payments directly to an office of the insurer or by preauthorized debit, check, bank draft, or similar plan, in an amount that fairly represents the saving in collection expense;
(3) readjustment of the rate of premium for a group insurance policy based on the loss or expense experience thereunder, at the end of the first or a subsequent policy year of insurance thereunder, which may be made retroactive only for that policy year;
(4) issuance of life or health insurance policies or annuity contracts at rates less than the usual rates of premiums for the policies or contracts, or modification of premium or rate based on amount of insurance; but the issuance or modification may not result in reduction in premium or rate in excess of savings in administration and issuance expenses reasonably attributable to the policies or contracts;
(5) a reward under a wellness program established under a health care plan that favors an individual if the wellness program meets the following requirements:
(A) the wellness program is reasonably designed to promote health or prevent disease;
(B) an individual has an opportunity to qualify for the reward at least once a year;
(C) the reward is available for all similarly situated individuals;
(D) the wellness program has alternative standards for individuals who are unable to obtain the reward because of a health factor;
(E) alternative standards are available for an individual who is unable to participate in a reward program because of a health condition;
(F) the insurer provides information explaining the standard for achieving the reward and discloses the alternative standards; and
(G) the total rewards for all wellness programs under the health insurance policy do not exceed 20 percent of the cost of coverage.</p>

There is no liability on the part of, and a cause of action of any nature may not arise against, the director of insurance or against an insurer, its authorized representatives, agents, or employees, or a person furnishing to the insurer information as to reasons for cancellation, for any statement made by any of them in a written notice of cancellation, or in any other communication, oral or written, specifying the reasons for cancellation, or the providing of information pertaining to a cancellation or for statements made or evidence submitted at a hearing conducted in connection with a cancellation.

              <p>Sec. 21.36.321.   Misrepresentation in financial institution sales.
In the sale of insurance by a financial institution, a person may not engage in any practice or use an advertisement that may tend to mislead or deceive a consumer or cause a consumer to erroneously believe that
(1) the insurance is backed by or a return on the insurance is guaranteed by the state, the federal government, the person, or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation;
(2) the state or federal government
(A) will pay a claim under an insurance contract that is an obligation of or was sold by the person;
(B) is responsible for the insurance sales activities of the person; or
(C) guarantees the credit of the person;
(3) for insurance that contains investment risk, the insurance does not contain investment risk, the principal may not be lost, or the value of the insurance may not decline;
(4) the lending of money, extension of credit, or a renewal of a loan is conditioned on the purchase of insurance from the person and that insurance may not be purchased from another source.</p>
