              <p>Sec. 13.26.031.   Facility of payment or delivery.
Any person under a duty to pay or deliver money or personal property to a minor may perform this duty, in amounts not exceeding $5,000 a year, by paying or delivering the money or property to (1) the minor, if the minor is married; (2) any person having the care and custody of the minor with whom the minor resides; (3) a guardian of the minor; or (4) a financial institution incident to a deposit in a federally insured savings account in the sole name of the minor and giving notice of the deposit to the minor. This section does not apply if the person making payment or delivery has actual knowledge that a conservator has been appointed or proceedings for appointment of a conservator of the estate of the minor are pending. The persons, other than the minor or any financial institution under (4) of this section, receiving money or property for a minor, are obligated to apply the money to the support and education of the minor, but may not pay themselves except by way of reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses for goods and services necessary for the minor's support. Any excess sums shall be preserved for future support of the minor and any balance not so used and any property received for the minor must be turned over to the minor when the minor attains majority. Persons who pay or deliver in accordance with provisions of this section are not responsible for the proper application thereof.</p>

            <content>
              <p>Sec. 13.26.121.   Testamentary appointment of guardian of minor.
The parent of a minor may appoint by will a guardian of an unmarried minor.  Subject to the right of the minor under
AS 13.26.126
, a testamentary appointment becomes effective upon filing the guardian's acceptance in the court in which the will is probated, if before acceptance, both parents are dead or the surviving parent is adjudged incapacitated. If both parents are dead, an effective appointment by the parent who died later has priority.  This state recognizes a testamentary appointment effected by filing the guardian's acceptance under a will probated in another state which is the testator's domicile.  Upon acceptance of appointment, written notice of acceptance must be given by the guardian to the minor and to the person having care of the minor, or to the minor's nearest adult relation.</p>

              <p>Sec. 13.26.126.   Objection by minor of 14 or older to testamentary appointment.
A minor of 14 or more years may prevent an appointment of a testamentary guardian for the minor from becoming effective, or may cause a previously accepted appointment to terminate, by filing with the court in which the will is probated a written objection to the appointment before it is accepted or within 30 days after notice of its acceptance.  An objection may be withdrawn.  An objection does not preclude appointment by the court in a proper proceeding of the testamentary nominee, or any other suitable person.</p>

The court may appoint a guardian for an unmarried minor if all parental rights of custody have been terminated or suspended by circumstances or prior court order.  A guardian appointed by will as provided in
AS 13.26.121
whose appointment has not been prevented or nullified under
AS 13.26.126
has priority over any guardian who may be appointed by the court but the court may proceed with an appointment upon a finding that the testamentary guardian has failed to accept the testamentary appointment within 30 days after notice of the guardianship proceeding.</p>

A guardian of a minor has the powers and responsibilities of a parent who has not been deprived of custody of a minor and unemancipated child, except that a guardian is not legally obligated to provide from the guardian's own funds for the ward and is not liable to third persons by reason of the parental relationship for acts of the ward.  In particular, and without qualifying the foregoing, a guardian
(1) must take reasonable care of the ward's personal effects and commence protective proceedings if necessary to protect other property of the ward;
(2) may receive money payable for the support of the ward to the ward's parent, guardian or custodian under the terms of any statutory benefit or insurance system, or any private contract, devise, trust, conservatorship or custodianship; the guardian also may receive money or property of the ward paid or delivered by virtue of
AS 13.26.031
; any sums so received shall be applied to the ward's current needs for support, care and education; the guardian must exercise due care to conserve any excess for the ward's future needs unless a conservator has been appointed for the estate of the ward, in which case excess shall be paid over at least annually to the conservator; sums so received by the guardian may not be used for compensation for the guardian's services except as approved by order of court or as determined by a duly appointed conservator other than the guardian; a guardian may institute proceedings to compel the performance by any person of a duty to support the ward or to pay sums for the welfare of the ward;
(3) may facilitate the ward's education, social, or other activities and authorize medical or other professional care, treatment, or advice; a guardian is not liable by reason of this consent for injury to the ward resulting from the negligence or acts of third persons unless it would have been illegal for a parent to have consented; a guardian may consent to the marriage or adoption of the ward;
(4) must report the condition of the ward and of the ward's estate which has been subject to the guardian's possession or control, as ordered by court on petition of any person interested in the minor's welfare or as required by court rule.</p>

            <content>
              <p>Sec. 13.26.171.   Termination of appointment of guardian; general.
A guardian's authority and responsibility terminate upon the death, resignation, or removal of the guardian or upon the minor's death, adoption, marriage, or attainment of majority, but termination does not affect the guardian's liability for prior acts, nor the obligation to account for funds and assets of the ward.  Resignation of a guardian does not terminate the guardianship until it has been approved by the court.  A testamentary appointment under an informally probated will terminates if the will is later denied probate in a formal proceeding.</p>

              <p>Sec. 13.26.201.   Purpose and basis for guardianship.
Guardianship for an incapacitated person shall be used only as is necessary to promote and protect the well-being of the person, shall be designed to encourage the development of maximum self-reliance and independence of the person, and shall be ordered only to the extent necessitated by the person's actual mental and physical limitations.  An incapacitated person for whom a guardian has been appointed is not presumed to be incompetent and retains all legal and civil rights except those that have been expressly limited by court order or have been specifically granted to the guardian by the court.</p>

The venue for guardianship proceedings for an incapacitated person is in the place where the incapacitated person resides or is present.  If the incapacitated person is admitted to an institution under order of a court of competent jurisdiction, venue is also in the judicial district in which that court sits.</p>

Within 90 days after distribution of the order of appointment as guardian, the guardian shall submit to the court a report. The report must describe the guardian's program for implementing the guardianship plan. The primary goal of the program described in the report must be, to the maximum extent possible, to develop or regain the ward's abilities to handle the ward's own affairs. The report must consider housing, medical care, and educational and vocational needs and resources. In developing the report, the guardian shall consult with the ward to the maximum extent possible. The report must specify the services that are necessary to meet the essential requirements for the ward's physical health or safety and the means for obtaining the services. The report must specify the manner in which the guardian will exercise and share decision-making authority and other items that will assist in fulfilling the needs of the ward, the terms of the guardianship order, and the duties of the guardian.</p>

The court has the following powers which may be exercised directly or through a conservator in respect to the estate and affairs of protected persons:
(1) while a petition for appointment of a conservator or other protective order is pending and after preliminary hearing and without notice to others, the court has power to preserve and apply the property of the person to be protected as may be required for the person's benefit or the benefit of the person's dependents;
(2) after hearing and upon determining that a basis for an appointment or other protective order exists with respect to a minor without other disability, the court has all those powers over the estate and affairs of the minor which are or might be necessary for the best interests of the minor, the minor's family and members of the minor's household;
(3) after hearing and upon determining that a basis for an appointment or other protective order exists with respect to a person for reasons other than minority, the court has, for the benefit of the person and members of the person's household, all the powers over the person's estate and affairs which the person could exercise if present and not under disability, except the power to make a will; these powers include, but are not limited to, power to make gifts, to convey or release contingent and expectant interests in property including marital property rights and any right of survivorship incident to joint tenancy or tenancy by the entirety, to exercise or release powers as trustee, personal representative, custodian for minors, conservator, or donee of a power of appointment, to enter into contracts, to create revocable or irrevocable trusts of property of the estate which may extend beyond the person's disability or life, to exercise options of the disabled person to purchase securities or other property, to exercise rights to elect options and change beneficiaries under insurance and annuity policies and to surrender the policies for their cash value, to exercise the right to an elective share in the estate of a deceased spouse, and to renounce any interest by testate or intestate succession or by inter vivos transfer;
(4) the court may exercise, or direct the exercise of its authority to exercise or release powers of appointment of which the protected person is donee, to renounce interests, to make gifts in trust or otherwise exceeding 20 percent of any year's income of the estate, or to change beneficiaries under insurance and annuity policies, only if satisfied, after notice and hearing, that it is in the best interests of the protected person, and that the protected person either is incapable of consenting or has consented to the proposed exercise of power;
(5) an order made pursuant to this section determining that a basis for appointment of a conservator or other protective order exists, has no effect on the capacity of the protected person.</p>

                <p>If, during the pendency of an initial petition for conservatorship, it appears that the respondent is in need of a protective order to protect the respondent against waste or dissipation of funds or property, or to obtain funds that are needed for the immediate support, care, and welfare of the respondent or persons entitled to be supported by the respondent, and the respondent is not capable of protecting the respondent's funds or property or obtaining the funds that are needed to support the respondent or persons whom the respondent is required to support, the petitioner may request the appointment of a temporary conservator to authorize the protection or to obtain the necessary funds. The request must state the reasons and factual basis for the request. The petitioner shall immediately file the request with the court and serve copies on the respondent and the respondent's attorney and other persons as ordered by the court. The court shall appoint an attorney for a respondent who is unrepresented to be at the hearing and conduct a hearing within 72 hours after the filing.</p>

A petition filed on behalf of a protected person by a person other than the protected person must be accompanied by proof of service of the petition on the protected person or the person's attorney unless service would cause an immediate threat of harm to the best interests of the protected person and the petition includes a written explanation of the harm. If the court finds that the petition establishes probable cause that the respondent is financially defrauding the petitioner or a person for whose benefit the petitioner filed the petition and that, because of the fraud, there has been or is an immediate threat of a waste or dissipation of the proposed protected person's funds or other property, the court shall ex parte and without notice to the respondent issue a protective order. The petitioner shall certify to the court in writing any effort that the petitioner made to provide notice to the respondent.</p>

On application filed with the court before the expiration of a 20-day ex parte protective order issued under
AS 13.26.450
, the court shall schedule a hearing on whether to convert the protective order to a temporary order effective for up to six months. The court shall provide to the protected person and the respondent at least 10 days' notice of the hearing and the respondent's right to appear and be heard. If the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the respondent has committed fraud against the petitioner or the person for whose benefit the petition was filed, regardless of whether the respondent appears at the hearing, the court may convert the ex parte protective order to a temporary protective order effective for up to six months.</p>

                <p>The court may require a conservator to furnish a bond conditioned upon faithful discharge of all duties of the trust according to law, with sureties as it shall specify.  Unless otherwise directed, the bond shall be in the amount of the aggregate capital value of the property of the estate in the conservator's control plus one year's estimated income minus the value of securities deposited under arrangements requiring an order of the court for their removal and the value of any land which the fiduciary, by express limitation of power, lacks power to sell or convey without court authorization. The court in place of sureties on a bond, may accept other security for the performance of the bond, including a pledge of securities or a mortgage of land.</p>

In the exercise of powers, a conservator shall act as fiduciary and shall observe the standards of care applicable to trustees under

            <content>
              <p>Sec. 13.26.505.   Inventory, implementation report, and records.
Within 90 days after distribution of the order of appointment, every conservator shall prepare and file with the appointing court a conservator implementation report and a complete inventory of the estate of the protected person together with an oath or affirmation that it is complete and accurate so far as the conservator is informed. The conservator shall provide a copy of it to the protected person if the protected person can be located, has attained the age of 14 years, and has sufficient mental capacity to understand these matters, and to any parent or guardian with whom the protected person resides. The conservator shall keep suitable records of the administration and exhibit them on request of any interested person.</p>

            <content>
              <p>Sec. 13.26.510.   Accounts.
A conservator shall submit a report to the court at least every year. In addition, a conservator shall account to the court for administration of the trust upon resignation or removal and at other times as the court may direct. On termination of the protected person's minority or disability, a conservator may account to the court or to the former protected person or the protected person's personal representative. Subject to appeal or vacation within the time permitted, an order, made upon notice and hearing, allowing an intermediate account of a conservator, adjudicates as to the conservator's liabilities concerning the matters considered in connection with it; and an order, made upon notice and hearing, allowing a final account, adjudicates as to all previously unsettled liabilities of the conservator to the protected person or the protected person's successors relating to the conservatorship. In connection with any account, the court may require a conservator to submit to a physical check of the estate in the conservator's control, to be made in any manner the court may specify.</p>

            <content>
              <p>Sec. 13.26.520.   Conservators; title by appointment.
The appointment of a conservator vests in the conservator title as trustee to all property of the protected person, presently held or thereafter acquired, including title to any property theretofore held for the protected person by custodians or attorneys-in-fact.  The appointment of a conservator is not a transfer or alienation within the meaning of general provisions of any federal or state statute or regulation, insurance policy, pension plan, contract, will or trust instrument, imposing restrictions upon or penalties for transfer or alienation by the protected person of any rights or interest, but this section does not restrict the ability of persons to make specific provision by contract or dispositive instrument relating to a conservator.</p>

              <p>Sec. 13.26.525.   Recording of conservator's letters.
Letters of conservatorship are evidence of transfer of all assets of a protected person to the conservator.  An order terminating a conservatorship is evidence of transfer of all assets of the estate from the conservator to the protected person, or the protected person's successors. Subject to the requirements of general statutes governing the recordation of documents of title to land or other property, letters of conservatorship, and orders terminating conservatorships, may be recorded to give record notice of title as between the conservator and the protected person.</p>

              <p>Sec. 13.26.530.   Sale, encumbrance, or transaction involving conflict of interest voidable.
Any sale or encumbrance to a conservator, the conservator's spouse, agent, or attorney, or any corporation or trust in which the conservator has a substantial beneficial interest, or any transaction which is affected by a substantial conflict of interest is voidable unless the transaction is approved by the court after notice to interested persons and others as directed by the court.</p>

            <content>
              <p>Sec. 13.26.535.   Persons dealing with conservators; protection.
A person who in good faith either assists a conservator or deals with the conservator for value in any transaction other than those requiring a court order as provided in
AS 13.26.435
, is protected as if the conservator properly exercised the power. The fact that a person knowingly deals with a conservator does not alone require the person to inquire into the existence of a power or the propriety of its exercise, except that restrictions on powers of conservators which are endorsed on letters as provided in
AS 13.26.550
are effective as to third persons.  A person is not bound to see to the proper application of estate assets paid or delivered to a conservator.  The protection here expressed extends to instances in which some procedural irregularity or jurisdictional defect occurred in proceedings leading to the issuance of letters.  The protection here expressed is not by substitution for that provided by comparable provisions of the laws relating to commercial transactions and laws simplifying transfers of securities by fiduciaries.</p>

Once a conservator knows that the protected person has died, the conservator may not exercise authority over the protected person's affairs and estate except to pay reasonable burial expenses and to preserve, account for, and transfer control of assets to a personal representative, a temporary property custodian appointed by the court, or a person authorized to take custody of personal property by affidavit under

Upon application for an order granting the powers of a personal representative to a conservator, after notice to any person demanding notice under

and to any person nominated executor in any will of which the applicant is aware, the court may order the conferral of the power upon determining that there is no objection, and endorse the letters of the conservator to note that the formerly protected person is deceased and that the conservator has acquired all of the powers and duties of a personal representative. The making and entry of an order under this section has the effect of an order of appointment of a personal representative as provided in

AS 13.26.540
and 13.26.545 or previously conferred by the court, and may at any time relieve the conservator of any limitation.  If the court limits any power conferred on the conservator by

The protected person, the protected person's personal representative, the conservator, or any other interested person may petition the court to terminate the conservatorship.

The court, upon determining after notice and hearing that the minority or disability of the protected person has ceased, may terminate the conservatorship.  Upon termination, title to assets of the estate passes to the former protected person or to the person's successors subject to provision in the order for expenses of administration or to conveyances from the conservator to the former protected person or the person's successors, to evidence the transfer.</p>

A power of attorney that satisfies the requirements of
AS 13.26.645
 13.26.665 is not prevented from being a statutory form power of attorney by the fact that it also contains additional language that
(1) eliminates from the power of attorney one or more of the powers enumerated in one or more of the subsections of 13.26.665 with respect to a section of the statutory form power of attorney that is not eliminated by the principal;
(2) supplements one or more of the powers enumerated in one or more of the subsections of
AS 13.26.665
with respect to a section of the statutory form power of attorney that is not eliminated by the principal by specifically listing additional powers of the agent;
(3) makes an additional provision that is not substantially inconsistent with the other provisions of the statutory form power of attorney; or
(4)  relieves an agent of liability for breach of a duty under
AS 13.26.610
, except to the extent the provision
(A)  relieves the agent of liability for breach of duty committed dishonestly, with an improper motive, or with reckless indifference to the purposes of the power of attorney or the best interest of the principal; or
(B)  was inserted as a result of an abuse of a confidential or fiduciary relationship with the principal.</p>

            <content>
              <p>Sec. 13.26.700.   Purpose.
The legislature recognizes that many Alaskans, for reasons of incapacity or minority, are in need of a guardian or conservator.  Often these persons cannot find a person able and willing to serve as guardian or conservator.  The legislature intends through
AS 13.26.700
 13.26.750 to establish the function of public guardian for the purpose of furnishing guardianship and conservatorship services.  It further intends by establishing this function to provide assistance to guardians throughout the state in securing necessary services for their wards and to assist the courts, attorneys, visitors, respondents, and proposed guardians in the orderly and expeditious handling of guardianship proceedings.</p>

              <p>Sec. 13.26.730.   Intervention by public guardian.
The public guardian may, on the public guardian's own motion or at the request of the court, intervene in a guardianship or conservatorship proceeding if the public guardian or the court considers the intervention to be justified because
(1) an appointed guardian or conservator is not fulfilling duties;
(2) the estate is subject to waste as a result of the costs of the guardianship or conservatorship;
(3) a willing and qualified guardian or conservator is not available; or
(4) the best interests of the ward, respondent, protected person, or person who is the subject of a conservatorship proceeding require the intervention.</p>

              <p>Sec. 13.26.740.   Staff; delegation of powers and duties.
The public guardian may employ staff and delegate to members of the staff or to volunteers the powers and duties as guardian or conservator and other powers and duties under this chapter. However, the public guardian retains responsibility for the proper performance of the delegated powers and duties. The public guardian may only delegate powers and duties under this chapter to an individual who meets the eligibility requirements of
AS 13.26.311
and has passed the criminal history record information check under
AS 08.26.070
. In addition, the individual must either hold a current certification as a guardian from a nationally recognized organization at the time of the delegation or apply for and receive that certification within one year of the delegation.</p>
