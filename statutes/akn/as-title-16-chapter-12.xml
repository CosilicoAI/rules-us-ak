                <p>A permit holder may, by a majority vote of the membership of the permit holder's board of directors, elect to harvest shellfish in a special harvest area established for a project under
AS 16.12.010
through the common property fishery. A permit holder seeking to harvest shellfish in a special harvest area through a common property fishery shall notify the Department of Revenue by July 1 of the year preceding the year for which the harvest is sought. At the request of the permit holder and if the commissioner determines that there are no allocative issues involved, and after reasonable consultation with affected commercial fishermen, the commissioner may adopt regulations governing the harvest of shellfish in a special harvest area through a common property fishery. The regulations must specify the terms, conditions, and rules under which the common property fishery in the special harvest area shall be conducted, including requirements for holding inspections and reporting of harvests and sales of shellfish taken in the special harvest area. Following adoption of regulations by the department, before January 15 of each year, the permit holder's board, by a majority vote of the board's membership, may determine whether the permit holder will operate under the regulations adopted under this subsection during the current calendar year and shall notify the department if the permit holder intends to operate under the regulations adopted under this subsection. The Board of Fisheries may adopt regulations under
AS 16.05.251
regarding a fisheries management plan governing operations under this subsection in a special harvest area, including allocation plans. Participation in the fishery must be open to all interim-use permit and entry permit holders who hold permits to operate a type of gear that may be used in the fishing district in which the special harvest area is located if that type of gear is authorized by regulation to be used in the special harvest area.

The assessment is levied on the shellfish that the commercial fisherman takes in the special harvest area and sells to a licensed buyer. The buyer of the shellfish must be licensed under
AS 43.75

The Department of Revenue shall set an annual assessment under this section not later than January 1 of that year. The assessment must provide sufficient revenue to cover debt service, reasonable operating expenses, reasonable maintenance expenses, and development or maintenance of a reserve fund up to 100 percent of annual operating costs of the permit holder's project under
AS 16.12.010
. In setting the assessment, the Department of Revenue shall consider the estimated harvest of shellfish in the special harvest area, the projected price to be paid for shellfish in the region, the amount of the existing reserve held by the permit holder, and the amount by which the assessment collected in previous years exceeded or fell short of the amount anticipated to be collected. The assessment may not exceed 50 percent of the value of the shellfish. The Department of Revenue may levy the assessment as a percentage of the projected value of the shellfish harvested in the special harvest area or as a flat rate on each pound of shellfish harvested in the area, to the nearest whole cent.</p>
