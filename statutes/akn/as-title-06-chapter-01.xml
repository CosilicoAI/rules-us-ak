A fee assessed under this subsection must include the proportionate part of the salaries and cost of employee benefits of the examiners while conducting examinations or investigations and while preparing reports of them, and transportation costs and per diem of each examiner while away from the examiner's duty station.  The cost to the financial institution in connection with an examination may not exceed the actual cost to the department of the examination.  The assessment shall be made by the commissioner as soon as feasible after the examination or investigation has been completed.  The assessment must be received by the department within 30 days after receipt of notice of the assessment by the institution.</p>
