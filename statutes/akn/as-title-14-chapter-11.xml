                <p>In order to receive a grant under this chapter or an appropriation under
AS 37.05.560
, a district must provide a percentage share of the project cost, as determined under (b) or (c) of this section.

                <p>The required participating share for a municipal school district is based on the district's full value per average daily membership (ADM), which is calculated by dividing the full and true value of the taxable real and personal property in the district, calculated as described in
AS 14.17.510
, by the district ADM as defined in
AS 14.17.990
, for the same fiscal year for which the valuation was made. The municipal district's full value per ADM determines the district's required participating share, as follows:
Full Value Per ADMDistrict Participating Share
$1  $150,0005 percent
150,001  275,00010 percent
