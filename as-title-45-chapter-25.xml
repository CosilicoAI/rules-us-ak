(8)  recover the manufacturer's costs for compensating a new motor vehicle dealer for warranty work by reducing the amount due to or imposing a separate charge, surcharge, administrative fee, or other similar cost on the new motor vehicle dealer; this paragraph does not prohibit a manufacturer from increasing the price of a new motor vehicle or changing a schedule of compensation in the ordinary course of business.</p>

A motor vehicle dealer may not refuse to sell a motor vehicle on the terms and conditions that the dealer has advertised. This section does not apply if
(1) the dealer can document that the advertised term or condition was the result of an error on the part of the advertising medium or an outside advertising agent; or
(2) the refusal is based on an error that was made in good faith by the dealer and was clearly and conspicuously a mistake, and the dealer corrected the error as soon as the dealer knew or reasonably should have known of the error.</p>
