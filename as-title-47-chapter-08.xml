(3) the committee may not reimburse a provider for the applicant's share of the total medical expenses; moreover, a reimbursement to the provider shall be conditioned on the provider's agreement that the provider enter into a payment schedule with the applicant which will result in full liquidation of the applicant's share; payment schedules may not be for a term of less than three years.</p>
