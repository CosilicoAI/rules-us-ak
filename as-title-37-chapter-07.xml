              <p>Sec. 37.07.010.   Statement of policy.
It is the purpose of this chapter to establish a comprehensive system for state program and financial management that furthers the capacity of the governor and legislature to plan and finance the services that they determine the state will provide for its citizens. The system must include procedures for
(1) the orderly establishment, continuing review, and periodic revision of the program goals and policies of state agencies and financial goals and policies of the state;
(2) the development, coordination, and review of long-range program and financial plans that will implement established state goals and policies;
(3) the preparation, coordination, analysis, and enactment of a budget that is organized to focus on the services provided by state agencies and on the cost of those services and that provides for implementation of policies and plans, in the succeeding budget period;
(4) the evaluation of alternatives to existing policies, plans, and procedures that offer potential for more efficient state services;
(5) the regular appraisal and reporting of program performance;
(6) public participation in the development of the annual budget, including opportunity for the public to review and comment upon the plans and programs of the Office of the Governor and all state agencies in the executive branch, the legislature, the judicial system, the University of Alaska, and the public corporations of the state.</p>
