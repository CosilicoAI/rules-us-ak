                <p>There shall be a provision that after three full years' premiums have been paid and after the policy has a cash surrender value and while no premium is in default beyond the grace period for payment, the insurer will advance, on proper assignment or pledge of the policy and on the sole security of the policy, at a specified rate of interest not exceeding eight percent a year, an amount equal to or, at the option of the party entitled to it, less than the loan value of the policy.  The director may authorize rates of interest in excess of six percent only on a finding that the holders of policies will benefit from the increased earnings of the insurer resulting from the higher rates, through the use of higher dividends or lower premiums, or both.  The loan value of the policy shall be at least equal to the cash surrender value at the end of the then current policy year, except that the insurer may deduct, either from the loan value or from the proceeds of the loan, an existing indebtedness not already deducted in determining the cash surrender value including interest then accrued but not due, the unpaid balance of the premium for the current policy year, and interest on the loan to the end of the current policy year.  The policy may also provide that if interest on an indebtedness is not paid when due it shall then be added to the existing indebtedness and shall bear interest at the same rate, and that if and when the total indebtedness on the policy, including interest due or accrued, equals or exceeds the amount of the loan value of the policy, the policy shall terminate and become void.  The policy must reserve to the insurer the right to defer the granting of a loan, other than for the payment of a premium to the insurer, for six months after the date of the loan application.

                <p>A policy issued on or after July 1, 1982, must have a provision specifying an interest rate on a policy loan not to exceed eight percent a year, or a provision permitting an adjustable maximum interest rate established under this subsection.  An adjustable maximum rate of interest on a policy loan determined under this subsection may not exceed the higher of the published monthly average for the calendar month ending two months before the date on which the rate is determined, or the rate used to compute cash surrender values under the policy during the applicable period plus one-twelfth of a percentage point multiplied by the number of months in the applicable period.  If an adjustable maximum rate of interest is used in a policy under this subsection, the policy must contain a provision that states times for the adjustment of the interest rate for that policy.  Adjustment shall occur at least once every 12 months, but not more often than once every three months.  The interest rate being charged may be increased if the published monthly average increases by one-half percent or more and the interest rate being charged must be reduced if the published monthly average decreases by one-half percent or more.  A life insurer shall (1) notify the policyholder of the initial rate of interest on the loan at the time a cash loan is made; (2) notify a policyholder who obtains a premium loan of the initial rate of interest on the loan as soon as it is reasonably possible to do so after making an initial premium loan; except as provided in (3) of this subsection, notice does not have to be given to the policyholder when a second or subsequent premium loan is added; (3) send reasonable advance notice of any increase in the rate to a policyholder who has a policy loan; and (4) include other relevant information on adjustment of interest rates in a notice required under this subsection.

              <p>Sec. 21.45.140.   Beneficiary, industrial policies.
An industrial life insurance policy must have the name of the beneficiary designated on it with a reservation of the right to designate or change the beneficiary after the issuance of the policy.  The policy may also provide that no designation or change of beneficiary shall be binding on the insurer until endorsed on the policy by the insurer, and that the insurer may refuse to endorse the name of proposed beneficiary who does not appear to the insurer to have an insurable interest in the life of the insured.  The policy may also provide that if the beneficiary designated in the policy does not make a claim under the policy or does not surrender the policy with due proof of death within the period stated in the policy, which may not be less than 30 days after the death of the insured, or if the beneficiary is the estate of the insured, or is a minor, or dies before the insured, or is not legally competent to give a valid release, the insurer may pay the proceeds to the executor or administrator of the insured, or to any relative of the insured by blood or legal adoption or connection by marriage, or to any person appearing to the insurer to be equitably entitled to the proceeds by reason of having been named beneficiary, or by reason of having incurred expense for the maintenance, medical attention, or burial of the insured.  The policy may also include a similar provision applicable to other payments due under the policy.</p>

Except as provided in (l) of this section, the calculations for all policies of industrial insurance shall be made on the basis of the 1941 Standard Industrial Mortality Table. All calculations shall be made on the basis of the rate of interest specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits.

                <p>This subsection, in addition to all other applicable subsections of this section, shall apply to all policies issued on or after January 1, 1987. The cash surrender value available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment due on a policy anniversary shall be in an amount which does not differ by more than two-tenths of one percent of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance be uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first 10 policy years, from the sum of the greater of zero and the basic cash value hereinafter specified and the present value of any existing paid-up additions less the amount of any indebtedness of the insurer under the policy. The basic cash value shall be equal to the present value on the policy anniversary of the future guaranteed benefits which would have been provided for by the policy, excluding any existing paid-up additions and before deduction of any indebtedness to the insurer if there had been no default, less the then present value of the nonforfeiture factors as defined in this subsection, corresponding to the premiums which would have fallen due on and after the policy anniversary. Provided, however, that the effects on the basic cash value of supplemental life insurance or annuity benefits or of family coverage as described in subsection (d) or (j), whichever is applicable, be the same as are the effects specified in (d) or (j) of this section, whichever is applicable, on the cash surrender values as defined in that subsection. The nonforfeiture factor for each policy year shall be an amount equal to a percentage of the adjusted premium for the policy year, as defined in (h), (i), (j) and (m) of this section, whichever is applicable.

                  <p>The interest rate used in determining minimum nonforfeiture amounts shall be an annual rate of interest determined as the lesser of three percent a year or the following, which shall be specified in the contract if the interest rate will be reset: (A) the five-year constant maturity treasury rate reported by the federal reserve as of a date, or average over a period, rounded to the nearest  1/  20 of one percent, specified in the contract not more than 15 months before the contract issue date or redetermination date under (D) of this paragraph; (B) reduced by 125 basis points; (C) where the resulting interest rate is not less than one percent; and (D) the interest rate must apply for an initial period and may be redetermined for additional periods; the redetermination date, basis, and period, if any, must be stated in the contract; the basis is the date or average over a specified period that produces the value of the five-year constant maturity treasury rate to be used at each redetermination date.</p>

The present value at the contract issue date, and at each following redetermination date, of the additional reduction may not exceed the market value of the benefit. The director may require a demonstration of the present value of the additional reduction and may disallow or limit the additional reduction if the demonstration does not prove that the present value of the additional reduction does not exceed the market value of the benefit.</p>

The present value shall be calculated on the basis of an interest rate not more than one percent higher than the interest rate specified in the contract for accumulating considerations to determine the maturity value, unless a higher rate is approved by the director under

The present value shall be calculated for the period before the maturity date on the basis of the interest rate specified in the contract for accumulating the net considerations to determine the maturity value, and increased by any existing additional amounts credited by the company to the contract.  For contracts which do not provide any death benefits before the commencement of any annuity payments, the present values shall be calculated on the basis of the interest rate and the mortality table specified in the contract for determining the maturity value of the paid-up annuity benefit.  However, in no event may the present value of a paid-up annuity benefit be less than the minimum nonforfeiture amount at that time.</p>
