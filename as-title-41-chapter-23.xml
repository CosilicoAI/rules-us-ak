The purpose of

(2) perpetuate and enhance public enjoyment of fish and wildlife and their habitat including fishing, hunting, trapping, viewing, and photography;
(3) perpetuate and enhance general public recreation in a quality environment;
(4) perpetuate and enhance additional public uses described in the Susitna Area Plan;
(5) allow additional public uses of the area in a manner compatible with the purposes specified in (1)  (4) of this section.</p>
