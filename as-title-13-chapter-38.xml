              <p>Sec. 13.38.300.   Power to convert to unitrust.
Unless expressly prohibited by the governing instrument, a trustee may release the power to adjust under
AS 13.38.210
and may convert a trust into a unitrust as described in
AS 13.38.300
 13.38.435 if
(1) the trustee determines that the conversion will enable the trustee to better carry out the intent of the settlor or testator and the purposes of the trust;
(2) the trustee gives written notice of the trustee's intention to release the power to adjust, of the trustee's intention to convert the trust into a unitrust, of the unitrust percentage selected, of the smoothing period selected, and of how the unitrust will operate, including what initial decisions the trustee intends to make under
AS 13.38.340
, to all the sui juris beneficiaries who
(A) are currently eligible to receive income from the trust;
(B) would be eligible, if a power of appointment were not exercised, to receive income from the trust if the interest of all of the beneficiaries eligible to receive income under (A) of this paragraph were to terminate immediately before the giving of the notice; and
(C) would, if a power of appointment were not exercised, receive a distribution of principal if the trust were to terminate immediately before the giving of the notice;
(3) there are at least one sui juris beneficiary under (2)(A) of this section and at least one sui juris beneficiary under (2)(B) or (C) of this section; and
(4) a sui juris beneficiary does not object to the conversion to a unitrust in a writing delivered to the trustee within 60 days after the mailing of the notice under (2) of this section.</p>

In deciding whether to exercise the power conferred by

, a trustee may consider, among other things,
(1) the size of the trust;
(2) the nature and estimated duration of the trust;
(3) the liquidity and distribution requirements of the trust;
(4) the need for regular distributions and preservation and appreciation of capital;
(5) the expected tax consequences of the conversion;
(6) the assets held in the trust; the extent to which they consist of financial assets, interests in closely held enterprises, tangible and intangible personal property, or real property; and the extent to which an asset is used by a beneficiary;
(7) to the extent reasonably known to the trustee, the need of the beneficiaries for present and future distributions authorized or required by the governing instrument;
(8) whether and to what extent the governing instrument gives the trustee the power to invade principal or accumulate income or prohibits the trustee from invading principal or accumulating income and the extent to which the trustee has exercised a power from time to time to invade principal or accumulate income;
(9) the actual and anticipated effect of economic conditions on principal and income and the effects of inflation and deflation.</p>

After a decedent dies in the case of an estate, or after an income interest in a trust ends, a fiduciary
(1) of an estate or of a terminating income interest shall determine the amount of net income and net principal receipts received from property specifically given to a beneficiary under (5) of this section and the provisions applicable to trustees in
AS 13.38.550
 13.38.860; the fiduciary shall distribute the net income and net principal receipts to the beneficiary who is to receive the specific property;
(2) shall distribute to a beneficiary or trust that receives a pecuniary amount a share of net income equal to the beneficiary's or trust's fractional interest in undistributed principal assets as determined under
AS 13.38.510
(a), (b)(1), (b)(3), and (c)  (e); the share accrues from the date of death of a decedent, in the case of an estate, or the date of death of a settlor or specified event, in the case of a revocable or irrevocable trust;
(3) shall determine the remaining net income of a decedent's estate or a terminating income interest under the provisions applicable to trustees in
AS 13.38.550

(A) including in net income all income from property used to discharge liabilities; and

, fees of personal representatives and their attorneys and accountants, and the taxes, related interest, and penalties described in
AS 13.38.810
(a)(7) that are apportioned to the estate or terminating income interest by the governing instrument or applicable law;
(4) shall distribute the net income remaining after distributions required by (2) of this section in the manner described in

to all other beneficiaries;
(5) may not reduce principal or income receipts from property described in (1) of this section because of a payment described in

(A) including all of the amounts the fiduciary receives or pays with respect to the property, whether those amounts accrued or became due before, on, or after the date of a decedent's death or an income interest's terminating event; and

              <p>Sec. 13.38.670.   Special rules for charitable remainder unitrusts.
Notwithstanding the other provisions of this chapter, if a charitable remainder unitrust, as defined in 26 U.S.C. 664 (Internal Revenue Code), owns an obligation described in (2) of this section, the following rules apply, unless varied by the governing instrument:
(1) an obligation for the payment of money is principal at its inventory value except as provided in (2) of this section; the trustee may not make a provision for amortization of a premium or for accumulation for discount;
(2) except to the extent otherwise provided in the governing instrument, an increase in the value of the following above inventory value is distributable as income:
(A) a zero coupon bond;
(B) an annuity contract before annuitization;
(C) a life insurance contract before the death of the insured;
(D) an interest in a common trust fund; in this subparagraph, common trust fund has the meaning given in 26 U.S.C. 584 (Internal Revenue Code);
(E) an interest in a limited liability company, limited liability partnership, or limited partnership; and
(F) another obligation for the payment of money if the money is payable at a future time under a fixed, variable, or discretionary schedule of appreciation and if the payment exceeds the price at which the obligation was issued;
(3) the increase in value of the obligations described in (2) of this section is distributable to the beneficiary who was the income beneficiary at the time of the increase; the increase is distributable from the first cash available from the principal or, if cash is not available from the principal, when cash is first available from the principal due to a sale, a redemption, or another disposition; when an unrealized increase is distributed as income from principal, the principal shall be reimbursed when the increase is realized;
(4) the increase in value of an obligation described in (2) of this section is not available for distribution unless the trustee receives cash on account of the obligation;
(5) notwithstanding a provision in this section to the contrary, a distribution from a partnership or limited liability company attributable to the cash flow or income derived from operations regularly carried on by the partnership or limited liability company is income, except to the extent otherwise provided in the governing instrument.</p>
