The following rules govern priority among conflicting security interests in the same deposit account:

rank according to priority in time of obtaining control;

(4) a security interest perfected by control under

 45.29.709, as those sections read on July 1, 2013, are satisfied on or before June 30, 2013; or
(2) when the applicable requirements for perfection are satisfied if the requirements are satisfied on or after July 1, 2013.</p>
