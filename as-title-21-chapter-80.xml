              <p>Sec. 21.80.010.   Purposes.
The purposes of this chapter are to provide a mechanism for the payment of covered claims under certain insurance policies to avoid excessive delay in payment and, to the extent provided in this chapter, to minimize financial loss to claimants or policyholders because of the insolvency of an insurer, and to provide an association to assess the cost of this protection among insurers.</p>

                <p>There is created a nonprofit incorporated legal entity to be known as the Alaska Insurance Guaranty Association. All insurers defined as member insurers in
AS 21.80.180
shall be and remain members of the association as a condition of their authority to transact insurance in this state. The association shall perform its functions under a plan of operation established and approved under
AS 21.80.070
and shall exercise its powers through a board of governors established under
AS 21.80.050
. For purposes of administration and assessment, the association shall be divided into three separate accounts: the workers' compensation insurance account; the automobile insurance account; and the account for all other insurance to which this chapter applies.</p>

(A) the assessments of each member insurer must initially be based on a uniform percentage, as determined by the association, of the net direct written premiums of each member insurer for the last year for which annual statements have been filed on the kinds of insurance in the account; this initial assessment shall be adjusted by applying the same uniform percentage as initially used to each member insurer's net direct written premiums for the calendar year following the year in which the initial assessment was issued; any difference between the initial assessment amount and the adjusted assessment amount allocated to a member insurer shall be levied against or credited back to the member insurer, as appropriate, by the association; the association shall calculate and issue all appropriate levies and credits as soon as practical after all member insurers have filed their annual statements for the calendar year following the year in which the initial assessment was issued;
(B) on an annual basis, the association shall determine if funding is required for any of the three accounts; based on this determination, the association shall, during November of each year, issue initial assessments as may be necessary to cover the projected reasonable costs of claims and expenses to administer the association for the following year; under this subparagraph,</p>

(ii) an initial assessment may be made at any other time if the association determines funding is necessary, except that a member insurer may not be assessed initial assessments on any account in an amount greater than two percent of the member insurer's net direct written premiums for the applicable calendar year;
(C) the association may pay claims in any order that it determines reasonable, including the payment of claims as they are received from claimants or in groups or categories of claims; however, if the maximum of all assessments made under this section, together with the other assets of the association in any account, does not provide, in any one year, in any account, an amount sufficient to make all necessary payments from that account, the funds available shall be prorated, and the unpaid portion shall be paid as soon thereafter as funds become available;
(D) the association may defer, in whole or in part, an assessment of any member insurer if the assessment would endanger the ability of the member insurer to fulfill the insurer's contractual obligations or cause the member insurer's financial statement to reflect amounts of capital or surplus less than the minimum amounts required for a certificate of authority by any jurisdiction in which the member insurer is authorized to transact insurance; however, during the period of deferment, the member insurer may not pay dividends to shareholders or policyholders; a deferred assessment may only be paid when the payment does not reduce capital or surplus below minimums required by law; a member insurer who pays a larger assessment as a result of a deferment given to another member insurer shall receive a refund when the deferment ends or, at the election of the member insurer, receive a credit against future assessments;

The rates and premiums charged for insurance policies to which this chapter applies may include surcharge rates sufficient to offset the adjusted assessments made under this chapter and paid to the association by member insurers, and these surcharge rates may not be considered excessive because they contain an amount reasonably calculated to offset the full amounted of adjusted assessments paid by member insurers. The association shall notify the director of each surcharge percentage determined by the association, and this surcharge percentage shall be the maximum surcharge rate that may be applied by member insurers related to the assessment, except that a member insurer may make application to the director to apply a higher surcharge rate. The amount charged on a policy shall be shown separate from the premium for coverage on the policy. The surcharge rate is not considered a premium and is not subject to the premium tax imposed under
