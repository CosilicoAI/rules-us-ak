The department may require that a municipal solid waste disposal facility furnish proof of financial responsibility. Proof of financial responsibility may be demonstrated by self-insurance, insurance, surety bond, corporate guarantee, letter of credit, certificate of deposit, or other proof of financial responsibility approved by the department, under regulations adopted by the department. Regulations adopted under this subsection must set financial tests for the acceptance of corporate guarantees and other forms of financial responsibility that the department determines would be required for an independent showing of financial capability. For a mining waste disposal facility, the department may accept as adequate to satisfy the requirement of this subsection financial assurance for reclamation provided to a state or federal land management agency if it otherwise meets the requirements of this subsection.

                  <p>the exact nature and extent of oil pollution can be neither documented with certainty nor precisely quantified on a spill-by-spill basis; however, in light of the magnitude of harm which may be caused by oil discharges, and the vital importance of commercial, sport, and subsistence fishing, tourism, and the state's natural abundance and beauty to the economic future of the state and its quality of life, it is the judgment of the legislature that substantial civil penalties should be imposed for the discharge of oil in order to provide a meaningful incentive for the safe handling of oil and to insure that the public does not bear substantial losses from oil pollution for which, because of its subtle, long-term, or unquantifiable nature, compensation would not otherwise be received; and</p>

                  <p>the handling of oil in large quantities is a hazardous undertaking that poses a significant threat to the economy and environment of the state, which can be substantially reduced only by the taking of rigorous safety precautions involving considerable expense; conversely, persons handling oil in smaller amounts pose a correspondingly lower risk to the economy and environment of the state, and are capable of safe oil handling practices at correspondingly lower costs; in order to provide an incentive that is effective, but not punitive, it is necessary and appropriate that the assessment of civil penalties for discharges of small quantities of oil be left for case-by-case judicial determination, while ensuring, through the penalty provisions of this section, that the handling of oil in large quantities occurs in a manner that will not impair the renewable resources of the state.</p>

              <p>Sec. 46.03.770.   Detention of vessel without warrant as security for damages.
A vessel that is used in or in aid of a violation of
AS 46.03.740
 46.03.750 may be detained after a valid search by the department, an agent of the department, a peace officer of the state, or an authorized protection officer of the Department of Fish and Game. Upon judgment of the court having jurisdiction that the vessel was used in, or was the cause of, a violation of
AS 46.03.740
 46.03.750 with knowledge of its owner or under circumstances indicating that the owner should reasonably have had this knowledge, the vessel may be held as security for payment to the state of the amount of damages assessed by the court under

, 46.03.759, 46.03.760, 46.03.822, and
AS 46.04.030
(g). If the damages assessed are not paid within 30 days after judgment or final determination of an appeal, the vessel shall be sold at public auction, or as otherwise directed by the court, and the damages paid from the proceeds. The balance, if any, shall be paid by the court to the owner of the vessel. The court shall permit the release of the vessel upon posting of a bond set by the court in an amount not to exceed the maximum amount of damages available under
AS 46.03.758
, 46.03.759, 46.03.760, 46.03.822, and
AS 46.04.030
