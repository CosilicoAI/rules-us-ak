              <p>Sec. 18.57.010.   Finding and purpose.
The legislature finds that an acute shortage of adequate, safe, reliable electrical facilities exists in the rural areas of the state and that adequate electrical systems cannot be provided by the private sector due to inadequate projected system revenues and economic depression in certain areas or by local governments of the state since the boundaries required for boroughs under  art. X, § 3, of the Alaska Constitution and the boundaries of cities necessary to effectively operate as cities would, in many cases, not be adequate to provide economic, adequate, safe, and reliable electrical service. The legislature further finds that adequate housing, public facilities, and economic development are heavily dependent upon adequate, safe, and reliable electrical facilities. These conditions are inimical to the safety, health, welfare, and prosperity of the residents of the state and to the sound growth of rural communities.  The legislature further finds that a reasonable means of accomplishing the purpose of providing adequate, safe, and reliable systems is the creation of regional electrical authorities that are not local governments.  It is the purpose and intent of the legislature to provide a means whereby public corporations to serve as regional electrical authorities may be formed.</p>

              <p>Sec. 18.57.060.   Validity of pledge.
The pledge of assets or revenue of the authority to the payment of the principal or interest of obligations of the authority is valid and binding from the time the pledge is made and assets or revenue pledged are immediately subject to the lien of the pledge without physical delivery or further action. The lien of a pledge is valid and binding against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract, or otherwise against the authority, irrespective of whether those parties have notice of the lien of the pledge.  Nothing prohibits the authority from selling assets subject to a pledge, except that a sale may be restricted by the trust agreement or resolution providing for the issuance of the obligations.</p>
