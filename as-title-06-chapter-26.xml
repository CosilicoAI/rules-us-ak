              <p>Sec. 06.26.690.   Authority to act as disbursing agent.
A purchasing trust company may hold the purchase price and any additional money or other assets delivered to it by the selling trust company in trust for the selling trust company and may act as an agent of the selling trust company in disbursing the money or other assets by paying the creditors of the selling trust company. If the purchasing trust company acts under a written contract of agency approved by the department that specifically names each creditor and the amount to be paid each creditor, and if the agency is limited to the purely ministerial act of paying creditors the amounts due them as determined by the selling trust company and reflected in the contract of agency and does not involve discretionary duties or authority other than the identification of the creditors named, the purchasing trust company
(1) may rely on the contract of agency and the instructions included in it; and
(2) is not responsible for
(A) an error made by the selling trust company when determining its liabilities, the creditors to whom the liabilities are due, or the amounts due to the creditors; or
(B) a preference that results from the payments made under the contract of agency and the instructions included in the contract.</p>

If a selling trust company is at any time after the sale of assets voluntarily or involuntarily closed for liquidation by a state or federal regulatory agency, the purchasing trust company shall pay to the receiver of the selling trust company the balance of the money or other assets held by the purchasing trust company in trust for the selling trust company and not yet paid to the creditors of the selling trust company. Without further action, the purchasing trust company is then discharged of all responsibilities to the selling trust company and the selling trust company's receiver, creditors, and shareholders.</p>

A purchasing trust company may pay a creditor of the selling trust company the amount to be paid the creditor under the terms of the contract of agency entered into under
AS 06.26.690
by opening an agency account in the name of the creditor, crediting the account with the amount to be paid the creditor under the terms of the agency contract, and mailing or personally delivering a duplicate of the written evidence of the credit to the creditor at the creditor's address shown in the records of the selling trust company.

The department may appoint the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or its successor as receiver for a trust company that the department has taken possession of if the deposits of the trust company are insured by that corporation or its successor. Upon filing with the court a certificate indicating the acceptance of the appointment by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or its successor, the possession of and title to all the assets, business, and property of the trust company are transferred to that corporation. The department is then relieved of all responsibility and liability with respect to the reorganization or liquidation of the trust company. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or its successor may liquidate, reorganize, merge, or consolidate the trust company in the manner permitted by the laws of the United States or by this chapter, and possesses all the rights, powers, duties, and obligations of the department in the liquidation, reorganization, merger, or consolidation of the trust company under this chapter.</p>
