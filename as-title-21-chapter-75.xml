The attorney-in-fact or other parties may advance to a domestic reciprocal insurer upon reasonable terms the funds it may require from time to time in its operations.

In determining the financial condition of a reciprocal insurer the director shall apply the following rules:
(1) the same reserves as are required of incorporated insurers issuing nonassessable policies on a reserve basis shall be charged as liabilities;
(2) the surplus deposits of subscribers shall be allowed as assets, except the premium deposits delinquent for 90 days shall first be charged against the surplus deposit;
(3) the surplus deposits of subscribers may not be charged as a liability;
(4) all premium deposits delinquent less than 90 days shall be allowed as assets;
(5) an assessment levied upon subscribers, and not collected, may not be allowed as an asset;
(6) the contingent liability of subscribers may not be allowed as an asset;
(7) the computation of reserves shall be based upon premium deposits other than membership fees and without deductions for expenses and the compensation of the attorney-in-fact.</p>

Individuals, partnerships, and corporations of this state may make application, enter into agreement for, and hold policies or contracts in or with and be a subscriber of a domestic, foreign, or alien reciprocal insurer.  A corporation now or hereafter organized under the laws of this state shall, in addition to the rights, powers, and franchises specified in its articles of incorporation, have full power and authority as a subscriber to exchange insurance contracts through the reciprocal insurer.  The right to exchange the contracts is incidental to the purposes for which the corporations are organized and to be as fully granted as the rights and powers expressly conferred upon the corporations.  Government or governmental agencies, state or political subdivisions, boards, associations, estates, trustees, or fiduciaries are authorized to exchange nonassessable reciprocal interinsurance contracts with each other and with individuals, partnerships, and corporations to the same extent that individuals, partnerships, and corporations are authorized to exchange reciprocal interinsurance contracts.  An officer, representative, trustee, receiver, or legal representative of a subscriber shall be recognized as acting for or on its behalf for the purpose of the contract but shall be personally liable upon the contract by reason of acting in the representative capacity.</p>

A subscriber of a domestic reciprocal insurer having contingent liability is liable for and shall pay the subscriber's share of any assessment, as computed and limited under this chapter, if
(1) while the subscriber's policy is in force or within one year after its termination, the subscriber is notified by either the attorney-in-fact or the director of an intention to levy the assessment; or
(2) an order to show cause why a receiver, conservator, rehabilitator, or liquidator of the insurer should not be appointed is issued while the subscriber's policy is in force or within one year after its termination.</p>
