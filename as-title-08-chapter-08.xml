The person by whom the applicant is employed, or, if the applicant is employed by a firm, the person under whose direction the applicant is to study, must have been admitted to practice law in the state for at least five years at the time the application for registration is filed, and be otherwise eligible to act as tutor. Before the commencement of the study of law under this section, the applicant shall file with the university an application to register as a law clerk. The application shall be made on a form to be provided by the university and shall require answers to interrogatories the university may determine from time to time to be relevant to a consideration of the application. Proof of a fact stated in the application may be required by the university. If the applicant fails or refuses to furnish any information or proof or answer any interrogatory required by the application, or independently by the university, in a manner satisfactory to the university, the application may be denied.</p>

If a registered law clerk finds it necessary to change tutors during the period of study, a new application for registration as a law clerk is required and such credit given for study under a prior tutor as the university may determine.</p>
