                <p>Notwithstanding (b) of this section, an employee who takes more than 10 days leave of absence without pay in a calendar year because the employee is unable to work due to an on-the-job injury or occupational illness for which the employee is receiving benefits under
AS 23.30
may elect to receive credited service for the time on leave of absence without pay status. When an employee elects to receive credited service under this subsection, an indebtedness is established. The amount of the indebtedness is equal to the contributions that the employee would have made if the employee had been working, less the sum of contributions that the employee made for those periods of time and an amount equal to contributions that would have been made for the first 10 days of leave without pay. Interest as prescribed by regulation accrues on the indebtedness beginning on the date that the employee returns to work or terminates employment. If there is an outstanding indebtedness at the time the employee is appointed to retirement, benefits shall be actuarially adjusted.</p>

The request may be made only after adoption of a resolution by the legislative body of the political subdivision and approval of the resolution by the person required by law to approve the resolution, or, in the case of a public organization, after adoption of a resolution by the governing body of that public organization. A certified copy of the resolution shall be filed with the administrator. An employer may not award past service to employees added to its participation agreement.

If a political subdivision or public organization amends its participation agreement so as to terminate coverage of a department, group, or other classification of employees, each employee whose coverage is so terminated, regardless of the employee's employment status at the date of termination, shall be considered fully vested in actuarially adjusted accrued retirement benefits as of the date of termination, unless</p>

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this plan, the annual additions to each member's individual account under this plan and under all defined contribution plans of the employer required to be aggregated with the contributions from this plan under the provisions of 26 U.S.C. 415 may not exceed, for any limitation year, the amount permitted under 26 U.S.C. 415(c) at any time. If the amount of a member's individual account contributions exceeds the limitation of 26 U.S.C. 415(c) for any limitation year, the administrator shall take any necessary remedial action to correct an excess contribution. A fixed benefit provided under this plan may not exceed, for or during a limitation year, the amount permitted under 26 U.S.C. 415(b). If a fixed benefit provided under this plan exceeds, for or during a limitation year, the amount permitted under 26 U.S.C. 415(b), the administrator shall take remedial action necessary to comply with the limits on the benefit amount in 26 U.S.C. 415(b). The provisions of 26 U.S.C. 415, and the regulations adopted under that statute, as applied to qualified plans of governmental employees are incorporated as part of the terms and conditions of the plan.</p>

              <p>Sec. 39.35.910.   Nonguarantee of returns, rates, or benefit amounts.
The plan created by
AS 39.35.700
 39.35.990 is, with respect to individual accounts, treated as a defined contribution plan, and not a defined benefit plan. The amount of money in the individual account of a participant depends on the amount of contributions and the rate of return from investments of the account that varies over time. If benefits are paid in the form of an annuity, the benefit amount payable is dependent on the amount of money in the account and the interest rates applied and service fees charged by the annuity payor at the time the annuity is purchased from the carrier and benefits are first paid. Nothing in this plan guarantees a participant
(1) a rate of return or interest rate other than that actually earned by the account of the participant, less applicable administrative expenses; or
(2) an annuity based on interest rates or service charges other than interest rates available from and service charges by the annuity payor in effect at the time the annuity is paid.</p>
