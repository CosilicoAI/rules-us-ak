Except in a finance lease, if the lessor at the time the lease contract is made has reason to know of a particular purpose for which the goods are required and that the lessee is relying on the lessor's skill or judgment to select or furnish suitable goods, there is in the lease contract an implied warranty that the goods will be fit for that purpose.</p>

Warranties, whether express or implied, shall be construed as consistent with each other and as cumulative, but if that construction is unreasonable, the intention of the parties determines which warranty is dominant. In ascertaining that intention the following rules apply:
(1) exact or technical specifications displace an inconsistent sample or model or general language of description;
(2) a sample from an existing bulk displaces inconsistent general language of description;
(3) express warranties displace inconsistent implied warranties other than an implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose.</p>

              <p>Sec. 45.12.216.   Third-party beneficiaries of express and implied warranties.
A warranty to or for the benefit of a lessee under this chapter, whether express or implied, extends to any natural person who may reasonably be expected to use, consume, or be affected by the goods and who is injured in person by breach of the warranty. This section does not displace principles of law and equity that extend a warranty to or for the benefit of a lessee to other persons. The operation of this section may not be excluded, modified, or limited, but an exclusion, modification, or limitation of the warranty, including an exclusion, a modification, or a limitation with respect to rights and remedies, effective against the lessee is also effective against the beneficiary designated under this section.</p>

Identification of goods as goods to which a lease contract refers may be made at any time and in any manner explicitly agreed to by the parties. In the absence of explicit agreement, identification occurs
(1) when the lease contract is made if the lease contract is for a lease of goods that are existing and identified;
(2) when the goods are shipped, marked, or otherwise designated by the lessor as goods to which the lease contract refers if the lease contract is for a lease of goods that are not existing and identified; or

(2) partial or the goods have so deteriorated as to no longer conform to the lease contract, the lessee may nevertheless demand inspection and at the lessee's option either treat the lease contract as avoided or, except in a finance lease that is not a consumer lease, accept the goods with due allowance from the rent payable for the balance of the lease term for the deterioration or the deficiency in quantity but without further right against the lessor.

              <p>Sec. 45.12.405.   Excused performance.
Subject to
AS 45.12.404
on substituted performance, the following rules apply:
(1) delay in delivery or nondelivery in whole or in part by a lessor or a supplier who complies with (2) and (3) of this section is not a default under the lease contract if performance as agreed has been made impracticable by the occurrence of a contingency the nonoccurrence of which was a basic assumption on which the lease contract was made or by compliance in good faith with an applicable foreign or domestic governmental regulation or order, whether or not the regulation or order later proves to be invalid;
(2) if the causes mentioned in (1) of this section affect only part of the lessor's or the supplier's capacity to perform, the lessor or supplier shall allocate production and deliveries among the customers of the lessor or supplier but at the option of the lessor or supplier may include regular customers not then under contract for sale or lease as well as the requirements of the lessor or supplier for further manufacture; the lessor or supplier may allocate under this paragraph in a manner that is fair and reasonable;
(3) the lessor seasonably shall notify the lessee and in the case of a finance lease the supplier seasonably shall notify the lessor and the lessee, if known, that there will be delay or nondelivery and, if allocation is required under (2) of this section, of the estimated quota made available for the lessee.</p>

                <p>A lessee's acceptance of goods precludes rejection of the goods accepted. In the case of a finance lease, if made with knowledge of a nonconformity, acceptance cannot be revoked because of it. In any other case, if made with knowledge of a nonconformity, acceptance cannot be revoked because of it unless the acceptance was on the reasonable assumption that the nonconformity would be seasonably cured. Acceptance does not of itself impair another remedy provided by this chapter or the lease agreement for nonconformity.</p>
