              <p>Sec. 24.45.011.   Purpose.
The legislature finds and declares that the operation of responsible representative democracy requires that the fullest opportunity be afforded to the people to petition their government for the redress of grievances and to express freely to individual members of the legislature, to its committees, and to officials of the executive branch, their opinions on pending legislation or administrative actions; and that the people are entitled to know the identity, income, expenditures, and activities of those persons who pay, are paid or reimbursed for expenses, or who make expenditures or other payments in an effort to influence legislative or administrative action.</p>

Reports required under this chapter shall be filed during the calendar month following each calendar month during any part of which the legislature was in session and during the month following each calendar quarter when the legislature was not in session.

The period covered shall be the calendar month or the calendar quarter, as applicable, and shall in any event cover the period from the date of the last report filed under this chapter to the date of the end of the calendar month or quarter, as applicable, for which the report is being filed.  The period covered shall not include any months covered in previous reports filed by the same person.  When total amounts are required to be reported, totals shall be stated both for the period covered by the statement and for the entire calendar year to date.</p>
