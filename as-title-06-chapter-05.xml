              <p>Sec. 06.05.145.   Adverse claim to bank deposit.
Notice to a bank of an adverse claim to a deposit standing on its books to the credit of a person is ineffective unless the adverse claimant procures a restraining order, injunction or other appropriate process against the bank from a court in a cause where the person to whose credit the deposit stands is made a party or executes to the bank in form and with sureties acceptable to it a bond, indemnifying the bank from any liability, loss, damage, costs and expenses on account of the payment of the adverse claim or the dishonor of the check or other order of the person to whose credit the deposit stands on the books of the bank. This section does not apply where the person to whose credit the deposit stands is a fiduciary for the adverse claimant, and the facts constituting that relationship and the facts showing a reasonable belief on the part of the claimant that the fiduciary is about to misappropriate the deposit are made to appear by the affidavit of the claimant.</p>

If a bank violates this subsection by transacting business before it receives a certificate of authority, the directors and officers who wilfully authorized or participated in the action are personally, jointly, and severally liable for the debts and liabilities of the bank incurred before the certificate of authority is issued.</p>

              <p>Sec. 06.05.474.   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as receiver or liquidator.
The department may appoint the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as receiver for a state bank that the department has taken possession of, if the deposits of the bank are insured by that corporation. Upon filing with the court a certificate indicating the acceptance of the appointment by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the possession of and title to all the assets, business, and property of the bank are transferred to that corporation. The department is then relieved of all responsibility and liability with respect to the reorganization or liquidation of the bank. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation may liquidate, reorganize, merge, or consolidate the bank in the manner permitted by the laws of the United States or by this chapter, and possesses all the rights, powers, duties, and obligations of the department in the liquidation, reorganization, merger, or consolidation of the bank under this chapter.</p>
