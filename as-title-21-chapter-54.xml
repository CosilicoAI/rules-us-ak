              <p>Sec. 21.54.010.   Required provisions of group policies.
Each group health insurance policy must contain in substance the following provisions:
(1) a provision that, in the absence of fraud, all statements made by applicants or the policyholder or by an insured person shall be considered representations and not warranties, and that a statement made for the purpose of effecting insurance may not void the insurance or reduce benefits unless contained in a written instrument signed by the policyholder or the insured person, a copy of which has been furnished to the policyholder or to the insured person or the beneficiary of the insured person;
(2) a provision that the insurer will furnish to the policyholder for delivery to each employee or member of the insured group, a statement in summary form of the essential features of the insurance coverage of the employee or member and to whom benefits are payable; if dependents are included in the coverage, only one certificate need be issued for each family unit;
(3) a provision that to the group originally insured may be added from time to time eligible new employees or members or dependents, as the case may be, in accordance with the terms of the policy.</p>

If an insurer fails to provide information requested by the director during the waiting period, the filing is considered withdrawn by the insurer, and the premium rate does not become effective.</p>

              <p>Sec. 21.54.030.   Required provisions of blanket policies.
An insurer authorized to write health insurance in this state shall have the power to issue blanket health insurance. A blanket policy may not be issued or delivered in this state unless a copy of the form of the policy has been filed in accordance with
AS 21.42.120
. Each blanket policy must contain provisions that in the opinion of the director are at least as favorable to the policyholder and the individual insured as the following:
(1) a provision that the policy, including endorsements and a copy of the application, if any, of the policyholder and the persons insured shall constitute the entire contract between the parties, and that any statement made by the policyholder or by a person insured shall in the absence of fraud be considered a representation and not a warranty, and that a statement may not be used in defense to a claim under the policy, unless contained in a written application; the person, a beneficiary, or assignee, shall have the right to make written request to the insurer for a copy of the application and the insurer shall, within 15 days after the receipt of the request at its home office or a branch office of the insurer, deliver or mail to the person making the request a copy of the application;
(2) a provision that written notice of sickness or of injury must be given to the insurer within 20 days after the date when the sickness or injury occurred; failure to give notice within that time may not invalidate or reduce a claim if it is shown that it was not reasonably possible to give the notice and that notice was given as soon as was reasonably possible;
(3) a provision that the insurer will furnish to the policyholder the forms that are usually furnished by it for filing proof of loss; if the forms are not furnished before the expiration of 15 days after the giving of the notice, the claimant shall be considered to have complied with the requirements of the policy as to proof of loss upon submitting, within the time fixed in the policy for filing proof of loss, written proof covering the occurrence, character, and extent of the loss for which claim is made;
(4) a provision that in the case of claim for loss of time for disability, written proof of the loss must be furnished to the insurer within 90 days after the beginning of the period for which the insurer is liable, and that subsequent written proofs of the continuance of the disability must be furnished to the insurer at the intervals that the insurer may reasonably require, and that in the case of claim for any other loss, written proof of the loss must be furnished to the insurer within 90 days after the date of the loss; failure to furnish the proof within that time does not invalidate or reduce a claim if it is shown that it was not reasonably possible to furnish the proof and that the proof was furnished as soon as was reasonably possible;
(5) a provision that all benefits payable under the policy other than benefits for loss of time will be payable immediately upon receipt of written proof of the loss, and that, subject to proof of loss, all accrued benefits payable under the policy for loss of time will be paid not later than at the expiration of each period of 30 days during the continuance of the period for which the insurer is liable, and that any balance remaining unpaid at the termination of the period will be paid immediately upon receipt of the proof;
(6) a provision that the insurer at its own expense shall have the right and opportunity to examine the person of the insured when and so often as it may reasonably require during the pendency of claim under the policy and also the right and opportunity to make an autopsy in case of death if it is not prohibited by law;
(7) a provision that a civil action may not be brought to recover under the policy before the expiration of 60 days after written proof of loss has been furnished in accordance with the requirements of the policy and that an action may not be brought after the expiration of three years after the time written proof of loss is required to be furnished.</p>

An insurer may, and upon written request of the covered person shall, within 30 working days after receiving a proof of loss statement, pay benefits directly to the provider of the hospital, nursing, medical, dental, or surgical services. The policy may not contain a provision requiring that services be provided by a particular hospital or person, except as applicable to a health maintenance organization under
AS 21.86
. If the insurer pays indemnities to the insured after the covered person has given the insurer written notice in the proof of loss statement of an election of direct payment of indemnities to the provider of the service, the insurer shall also pay those indemnities to the provider of the service.</p>
