                <p>A permit terminates if a permittee does not begin surface coal mining operations under the permit within three years after the permit is issued.  The commissioner may grant reasonable extensions of time if the permittee shows that the extensions are necessary (1) because of litigation that precludes the commencement of the operation or threatens substantial economic loss to the permittee; or (2) for reasons beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the permittee. With respect to coal to be mined for use in a synthetic fuel facility or specific major electric generating facility, the permittee is considered to have begun surface mining operations at the time that the construction of the synthetic fuel or generating facility is begun.</p>

The commissioner shall adopt regulations consistent with the environmental performance standards of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 and the regulations promulgated under that Act for both surface coal mining and reclamation operations and surface effects of underground mining with appropriate adjustments to the special physical, hydrological, biological, and climatic conditions in the state. All permits issued under this chapter shall require that surface coal mining and reclamation operations and coal exploration activities must comply with those environmental performance standards.</p>

                <p>The commissioner may assess a civil penalty against a person if the person or the person's operation violates a condition of a permit or a provision of this chapter.  If as a result of the violation the commissioner issues a cessation order under
AS 27.21.240
, the commissioner shall assess a civil penalty. The civil penalty may not exceed $5,000 for a violation.  The commissioner may consider each day of a continuing violation as a separate violation for the purposes of this subsection. In determining whether to assess and the amount of a civil penalty, the commissioner shall consider the person's history of previous violations at the site of the operation, the seriousness of the violation, including the irreparable harm done to the environment and the hazard created to the health or safety of the public, the person's negligence, and the good faith of the person in attempting to achieve rapid compliance after receiving notification of the violation.</p>

to a person, the commissioner shall inform the person of the amount of the penalty.  The person notified of the penalty then has 30 days in which to pay the penalty in full or to contest either the amount of the penalty or the fact of the violation.  If the person wishes to contest either the amount of the penalty or the fact of the violation, the person may submit to the commissioner a bond equal to the penalty amount at the time the person files an application for review.  The bond shall be conditioned for the satisfaction of the penalty in full if the commissioner's determination of an occurrence of a violation and the assessment of a penalty are affirmed.  An application for review is effective when the bond is approved by the commissioner.  If the bond is not approved, the person charged with the penalty shall forward the proposed amount to the commissioner within 10 days of the disapproval of the bond for placement in an escrow account in order to make the petition effective.</p>

If a public hearing is held, the commissioner shall make findings of fact and shall issue a written decision relating to the occurrence of the violation and the amount of the civil penalty that is warranted.

The commissioner may take the actions necessary to ensure state participation to the fullest extent practicable in the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund created in 30 U.S.C. 1231 and to function as the state agency for that participation.  In conformity with the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, the commissioner shall
(1) by regulation, establish priorities that meet the terms of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 for the expenditure of money received by the commissioner from the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund;
(2) designate land and water eligible for reclamation or abatement with money received by the commissioner from the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund;
(3) submit reclamation plans, annual projects, and applications to the appropriate authorities under the terms of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977; and
(4) administer money received by the state for abandoned mine reclamation or related purposes from the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund.</p>

AS 27.21.290
to restore or reclaim privately owned real property or to abate, control, or prevent the adverse effects of past surface coal mining practice on privately owned real property, the commissioner shall itemize the money spent on the project.  If the project results or will result in a significant increase in the real property's fair market value, the commissioner may file a statement of the money spent in the recording office in the area in which the real property is located with a notarized appraisal by a licensed appraiser of the fair market value of the real property before the project began. The statement constitutes a lien on the real property as of the date of the expenditure which is second only to the lien of property taxes.  The lien may not exceed the amount determined by either of two appraisals to be the increase in the fair market value of the real property as a result of the project.  A lien may not be filed under this subsection against real property of a person who owned the surface before May 2, 1977, and who did not consent to, participate in, or exercise control over the surface coal mining operation that necessitated the project.</p>

(1) the experimental practices are, during and after the surface coal mining operation, potentially more protective of the environment than, or at least as protective of the environment as, those required by this chapter and regulations adopted under it;
(2) the surface coal mining operation for which the departure is authorized is not larger than necessary to determine the effectiveness and economic feasibility of the experimental practices; and
