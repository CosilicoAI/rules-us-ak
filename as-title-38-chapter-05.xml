 29.65.030 that has a state-issued land lease that has been issued competitively under

An application for a preference right under this section must be filed with the director within 120 days after notice to the lessee of the municipal entitlement land selection. If the director grants the preference right, the director shall sell the land at a price determined by the director to represent the current fair market value of the unimproved land determined by an appraisal under

and a survey, both at the cost of the applicant. If the director determines that the purchase of the land would interfere with public use by residents of the area, the director may condition the purchase to mitigate the adverse effects on the public in the written finding under (e) of this section or may reject the application if those effects cannot be avoided or mitigated. If the preference right application is approved, the amount of land within the overall municipal entitlement under

The commissioner shall determine the land to be disposed of for private use. The commissioner shall determine the time and place of disposal.

              <p>Sec. 38.05.055.   Auction sale or sealed bid procedures.
Unless another method of sale is required under this chapter,
AS 38.08
, or
AS 38.09
, the sale of state land shall be made at public auction or by sealed bid, at the discretion of the director, to the highest qualified bidder as determined by the director. The director may accept bids and sell state land under this section at not less than 70 percent of the appraised fair market value of the land. To qualify to participate under this section in a public auction or sale by sealed bid of state land that is other than commercial, industrial, or agricultural land, a bidder shall have been a resident of the state for at least one year immediately preceding the date of the sale and submit proof of that fact, as the commissioner requires by regulation. A bidder may be represented by an attorney or agent at a public auction. An aggrieved bidder may appeal to the commissioner within five days after the sale for a review of the director's determination. The sale shall be conducted by the director, and, at the time of sale, the successful bidder shall deposit an amount equal to five percent of the purchase price. The director shall immediately issue a receipt containing a description of the land or property purchased, the price bid, and the amount deposited. The receipt shall be acknowledged in writing by the bidder.</p>

The lottery shall be conducted in public by the commissioner. A purchaser selected by lot shall deposit an amount equal to five percent of the purchase price within 30 days after receiving notification of the selection.</p>

If the director cannot determine a preference between conflicting applicants for the same lease site on the basis of qualifications, the director shall select between the applicants by lot. An aggrieved applicant may appeal to the commissioner within 30 days for a review of the director's determination.</p>

              <p>Sec. 38.05.120.   Disposal procedure.
Timber shall be sold either by sealed bids or public auction, depending on which method is determined by the commissioner to be in the best interests of the state, to the highest qualified bidder as determined by the commissioner. An aggrieved bidder may appeal to the commissioner within five days after the sale for a review of the determination. The sale shall be conducted by the commissioner, and, at the time of sale, the successful bidder shall deposit the amount specified in the terms of sale. The means by which the amount of deposit is determined shall be prescribed by appropriate regulation. The commissioner shall immediately issue a receipt containing a description of the timber purchased, the price bid, and the terms of sale. The receipt shall be accepted in writing by the bidder. A contract of sale, on a form approved by the attorney general, shall be signed by the purchaser, and the contract shall be signed by the commissioner on behalf of the state. The commissioner may impose conditions, limitations, and terms considered necessary and proper to protect the interests of the state. Violation of any provision of this chapter or the terms of the contract of sale subjects the purchaser to appropriate legal action.</p>

                <p>Where prospecting or exploration work is necessary to determine the existence or workability of coal deposits in an unclaimed and undeveloped area, the commissioner may issue to qualified applicants prospecting permits for a term of three years, covering not more than 5,120 acres with each permit. The commissioner shall grant a two-year extension of the initial three-year term of the permit if the permittee has conducted reasonably diligent prospecting or exploration activities in the area covered by the permit, has not been able to determine the existence and workability of coal deposits in the area, and wishes to continue prospecting or exploring in the area.  The commissioner may grant up to three two-year extensions of the initial three-year term of the permit.  At any time during the period of the permit, the permittee is entitled to a lease after submitting a mining plan satisfactory to the commissioner for that portion of the land in the permit as is shown to the satisfaction of the commissioner to contain coal in commercial quantities or to be needed for mining, reclamation, or processing the coal.</p>

                <p>To avoid waste or to promote conservation of natural resources, the commissioner may authorize the subsurface storage of oil or gas, whether or not produced from state land, in land leased or subject to lease under this section. This authorization may provide for the payment of a storage fee or rental on the stored oil or gas, or, instead of the fee or rental, for a royalty other than that prescribed in the lease when the stored oil or gas is produced in conjunction with oil or gas not previously produced. A lease on which storage is so authorized shall be extended at least for the period of storage and so long thereafter as oil or gas not previously produced is produced in paying quantities. Notwithstanding the authorization for payments under this subsection, when requested by a lessee, the commissioner shall exempt a gas storage facility that qualifies for a tax credit under
AS 43.20.046
from any payment described in this subsection for the periods described in this subsection. The exemption is available for the calendar year in which the facility commences commercial operation and for each of the nine calendar years immediately following the first year of commercial operation; however, an exemption is not applicable for the calendar year after the facility ceases commercial operation or for any subsequent calendar year. The lessee shall provide the commissioner with any information the commissioner requests to determine if the exemption applies. The information related to state land leased for a gas storage facility under this subsection is public information and may be furnished to the Regulatory Commission of Alaska. On request, the commissioner shall provide the name of each person using state land leased for a gas storage facility under this chapter, the years for which an exemption was granted, and the amount of the exemption. Gas withdrawn from a gas storage facility regulated under
AS 42.05
is considered to be non-native gas and is not considered to be pr</p>

                <p>On state land that has not been declared a competitive geothermal area or withdrawn from geothermal prospecting, the commissioner may issue a prospecting license to the first qualified applicant. The license conveys an exclusive right, for a period of five years, to prospect for geothermal resources on state land included under the license. The commissioner has discretion to renew the license for an additional one-year term. A holder of a prospecting license has the right, after completion of an agreed-on work commitment and the submission of an exploration plan acceptable to the commissioner, to convert the license to a noncompetitive lease at a royalty rate under (g) of this section. The conversion privilege must be exercised not later than 30 days after the expiration of the license. If the land included within the license is designated a competitive geothermal area during the license term, the licensee must apply for a noncompetitive lease within 30 days after notification of the designation or forfeit the conversion privileges and the exclusive right to prospect.</p>

                <p>The legislature finds that Kachemak Bay is an area of extraordinary abundance and diversity of marine life that has provided, and will continue to provide in the future, a basis for one of the state's most important commercial fisheries; that recent information discloses that even minute quantities of oil released into the marine environment may be harmful to the larval forms of crabs and other marine life and that the existence of gyral currents within the bay may increase the likelihood of oil coming into contact with these valuable commercial fish and shellfish species; and that therefore oil and gas development in the bay, at this time, presents an undue hazard to this valuable state renewable resource.</p>

                <p>Labor shall be performed or improvements made annually on or for the benefit or development of each mining claim, leasehold location, and mining lease on state land, except that, where adjacent claims, leasehold locations, or mining leases are held in common, including adjacent federal or private mineral interests held in common, the expenditure may be made on or for the benefit of any one claim, leasehold location, mining lease, or mineral interest. The commissioner shall establish the date of the commencement of the year during which the labor or improvements are to be performed. Labor shall be performed at the following annual rates: (1) $100 for each claim, leasehold location, or lease if the claim, leasehold location, or lease is a quarter-quarter section MTRSC claim, leasehold location, or lease; (2) $400 for each quarter section MTRSC claim, leasehold location, or lease; and (3) $100 for each partial or whole 40 acres of each mining claim, leasehold location, or lease not established using the MTRSC system. If more work is performed than is required by this section to be performed in any one year, the excess value may be applied against labor required to be done during the subsequent year or years, for as many as four years. For not more than five consecutive years, instead of performing annual labor, the holder of a claim, leasehold location, or mining lease may make a cash payment to the state equal to the value of the labor required by this subsection.</p>

              <p>Sec. 38.05.500.   Electorate determinations.
The people of the State of Alaska determine that:
(1) the intent of the framers of the Constitution of the United States was to guarantee to each of the states sovereignty over all matters within its boundaries except for those powers specifically granted to the United States as agent of the states;
(2) the attempted imposition upon the State of Alaska by the Congress of the United States of a requirement in the Statehood Act that the State of Alaska and its people disclaim all right and title to any land or other property not granted or confirmed to the state or its political subdivisions by or under the authority of this Act, the right or title to which is held by the United States or is subject to disposition by the United States, as a condition precedent to acceptance of Alaska into the Union, was an act beyond the power of the Congress of the United States and is thus void;
(3) the purported right of ownership and control of the public land in the State of Alaska by the United States is without foundation and violates the clear intent of the Constitution of the United States; and
(4) the exercise of that dominion and control of the public land in the State of Alaska by the United States works a severe, continuous and debilitating hardship upon the people of the State of Alaska.</p>

In every case the applicant shall submit evidence that it is exempt from payment of federal income tax.  As a condition of and in consideration of the rights acquired under a lease granted under (b)  (d) of this section, each eligible organization and its parent or subsidiary organizations shall (1) maintain and preserve books, accounts, and records that the director prescribes by regulation as necessary and appropriate; and (2) accord at all reasonable times to the state and its authorized agents and auditors the right of access to those books, accounts and records for the purpose of inspecting, examining and copying them.

                <p>The director may lease the land to an eligible applicant at a reasonable annual rental, taking into consideration the purposes for which the land is to be used and the financial resources of the applicant.  The rental may not be less than one percent of the fair market value on land acquired primarily for development, or less than five percent of the fair market value on acquired land.  Rent may not be charged for state land leased for a youth encampment.  For the purposes of this subsection, youth encampment shall be defined by the commissioner by regulation.  Renewal leases may be issued at the discretion of the director upon the expiration of a primary or renewal term.  Each lease shall contain a provision for its termination as to all or part of the land upon a finding by the director that the land or a part of it has not been used by the lessee for the purpose specified in the lease for a period of two years.  No lease may be assigned or subleased except with the consent of the director, and in any case may only be transferred to an applicant eligible under (b)  (d) of this section.  A lessee may not change the use specified in the lease to another or additional use except with the consent of the director.  If, at any time after the land is leased, the lessee attempts to assign the lease or transfer control over the land to another, or if the land is devoted to a use other than that for which the land was leased without the consent of the director, the lease automatically terminates.</p>

                <p>The commissioner may require an applicant seeking the sale, lease, or other disposal of land or an interest in land, other than under an oil and gas lease, gas only lease, or mineral lease, to deposit an amount covering the estimated cost of an appraisal, survey, and other costs necessary to offer the land or interest in land, including advertising. All deposited funds not expended shall be refunded to the applicant. If the land or interest in land is awarded to a person other than the applicant making the deposit, the person awarded the land shall pay the total actual cost incurred by the department in making the disposal, and the deposit shall be returned to the original applicant. In lieu of requiring the deposit under this subsection, the commissioner may enter into an agreement with an applicant seeking land or an interest in land requiring the applicant to reimburse the department for costs incurred in the disposal if the applicant is awarded the land or interest in land.</p>

                <p>Except as provided in (c) of this section, if a competitive sale or lease of state land, minerals, timber, or materials is to be made by sealed bid, the director may require each bidder to submit an earnest money deposit with each bid.  If the sale or lease is by public auction, the director may require each person desiring to bid to make an earnest money deposit before bidding.  The earnest money deposit of the highest qualified bidder shall be applied toward the sale or lease price. If the successful bidder defaults in the payment of the amount bid, the deposit shall be forfeited to the state.  All other earnest money deposits shall be returned unless the commissioner decides to award the contract to the second highest qualified bidder upon default by the highest bidder rather than call for new bids, in which case the commissioner may retain the deposit of the second highest qualified bidder until final disposition of the land is made.  A successful bidder for a mineral lease who can prove to the satisfaction of the commissioner within 45 days after notification of the lease award that there is a reasonable doubt as to the ability of the state to grant a valid lease to the land may withdraw the amount bid and have the earnest money deposit returned.</p>

The right, title, or interest of a bona fide purchaser of any lease, interest in a lease, or option to acquire a lease or an interest in it, acquired after the effective date of issuance of the lease and held by a qualified person, association, or corporation in conformity with this chapter may not be canceled or forfeited or otherwise adversely affected by reason of the fact that the holding of the person, association, or corporation from which the lease, interest, or option was acquired, or of a predecessor in title, including the original lessee of the state, may have been canceled or forfeited, or may be or have been subject to cancellation or forfeiture.  If, in any proceeding for cancellation or forfeiture, an underlying lease, interest, or option is canceled or forfeited to the state and there are valid interests therein or valid options to acquire the lease or an interest therein which are not subject to cancellation or forfeiture, the underlying lease, interest, or option shall be sold by the director to the highest responsible qualified bidder by competitive bidding under general competitive leasing regulations subject to all outstanding valid interests therein and valid options pertaining thereto.  Likewise if, in any such proceeding, less than the whole interest in a lease, interest, or option is canceled or forfeited to the state, the partial interests so canceled or forfeited shall be sold by the director to the highest responsible qualified bidder under general competitive leasing regulations.</p>
