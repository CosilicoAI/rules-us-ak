                <p>The commission shall design and implement a project for the purposes of studying risk factors related to criminal activity, informing the legislature's policy and funding decisions related to primary crime prevention, and improving primary crime prevention strategies in the state. Under the project, the Department of Corrections shall transmit information about offenders sentenced to serve terms of incarceration of 30 days or more to the commission, and the commission shall analyze the information and provide to the legislature, in the report required under
AS 44.19.647
, the commission's conclusions and findings. The commission shall, in consultation with the Justice Center and the Alaska Justice Information Center at the University of Alaska, the Alaska Judicial Council, the Department of Corrections, and other relevant entities or state agencies, create a list of the types of information and inmate characteristics the Department of Corrections shall collect for the project and may revise the list when necessary to meet project goals. The information may include data relating to adverse childhood experiences, mental health and substance abuse history, education, income, and employment of inmates. The Department of Corrections shall adopt policies establishing procedures for collecting the information identified in the list required under this subsection and providing the information to the commission. The procedures may provide for the collection of the information as part of the risk assessment program established under
AS 33.30.011
(a)(7). In this subsection, primary crime prevention means intervention programs and strategies designed to reduce crime risk factors among the general population and prevent crime from happening.</p>
