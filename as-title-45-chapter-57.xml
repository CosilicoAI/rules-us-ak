              <p>Sec. 45.57.010.   Provisions of takeover bids.
The following provisions apply to every takeover bid:
(1) the period of time within which securities may be tendered by an offeree under a takeover bid shall not be less than 21 days nor more than 35 days from the date copies of the takeover bid are first published or sent or given to offerees;
(2) securities deposited under a takeover bid may be withdrawn by an offeree or the attorney-in-fact of the offeree by demand in writing on the offeror or the depository at any time within 21 days from the date copies of the takeover bid are first published or sent or given to offerees;
(3) when a takeover bid is made for less than all the shares or other units of a class and when a greater number of shares or other units is deposited under it than the offeror is bound or willing to take up and pay for, the shares or other units taken up by the offeror shall be taken up as nearly as may be pro rata, disregarding fractions, according to the number of shares or other units deposited;
(4) when an offeror varies the terms of a takeover bid before the expiration of it by increasing the consideration offered, the offeror shall pay the increased consideration to each offeree whose securities are taken up even if they have been taken up and paid for before the variation of the takeover bid;
(5) when a takeover bid is sent by mail to offerees, it shall be accompanied by a copy of the statement filed with the department under
AS 45.57.020
