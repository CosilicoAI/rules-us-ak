                <p>The legislature declares its intention to provide for carrying out the purposes of this chapter in cooperation with the appropriate agencies of other states and the federal government, as part of a nationwide employment security program, and particularly to provide for meeting the requirements of Title III of the Federal Social Security Act, the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 3303 and 3304 (Federal Unemployment Tax Act, Internal Revenue Code), and the Act of Congress approved June 6, 1933, entitled An Act to provide for the establishment of a national employment system and for cooperation with the states in the promotion of such system, and for other purposes (cited in this chapter as the Wagner-Peyser Act), and Title IV of the Act of Congress approved June 22, 1944, each as amended, in order to obtain for this state and its citizens the grants and privileges available under the federal Act.  Doubt as to the proper construction of a provision of this chapter shall be resolved in favor of conformity with the requirements of the federal Act.</p>

              <p>Sec. 23.20.010.   Policy.
As a guide to the interpretation and application of this chapter, the public policy of the state is declared to be as follows: Economic insecurity due to involuntary unemployment is a serious menace to the health, morals, and welfare of the people of the state. Involuntary unemployment is, therefore, a subject of general interest and concern which requires appropriate action by the legislature to prevent its spread and to lighten its burden and to maintain purchasing power as a factor in stabilizing the economy of the state.  This can be accomplished by encouraging employers to provide more stable employment and by the systematic accumulation of funds during periods of employment, from which benefits may be paid for periods of involuntary unemployment.  The legislature, therefore, declares that, in its considered judgment, the public good and the general welfare of the citizens of the state require the enactment of this measure, under the police power of the state, for the operation of public employment service offices and for the establishment of an employment security program to be used for the benefit of eligible unemployed persons.</p>

Refunds of interest and penalties erroneously collected may be made from the clearing account of the unemployment compensation fund or from the training and building fund if they were transferred to and deposited in that fund.  Interest and penalty payments may not be refunded from the unemployment compensation fund.

If the department has reason to believe that an employer is insolvent or if the collection of contributions accrued will be jeopardized by delaying collection, the department may make an immediate assessment and may proceed to enforce collection immediately.

An employer who has been subject to this chapter less than four calendar quarters immediately preceding the computation date is not entitled to a rate determination under

If an employer's payroll in a calendar quarter is less than the payroll in the preceding quarter in the qualifying period, the quarterly decline quotient shall be computed to at least nine decimal places by dividing the amount of the decline by the amount of the payroll in the preceding calendar quarter.</p>

That percentage is 76 percent beginning January 1, 2009, and 73 percent beginning January 1, 2010. However, the rate of contributions for an employer may not be less than one percent or more than six and one-half percent.

              <p>Sec. 23.20.392.   Deductions from back pay awards.
An employer who makes a deduction from a back pay award to an insured worker because of the insured worker's receipt of benefits under this chapter for which the insured worker is ineligible by reason of the back pay award, shall pay into the unemployment trust fund an amount equal to the amount of the deduction.  If an employer making a payment under this section has already reimbursed the department for the benefits under
AS 23.20.276
and 23.20.277, the account of the employer shall be properly credited.  The insured worker's liability under
AS 23.20.390
shall be reduced by the amount paid by the employer under this section.</p>

                <p>In this chapter, wages means all remuneration for service from whatever source, including insured work, noninsured work, or self-employment; commissions, bonuses, back pay, and the cash value of all remuneration in a medium other than cash shall be treated as wages; gratuities customarily received by an individual in the course of service from persons other than the individual's employing unit may be treated as wages received from the employing unit only to the extent the individual reports the gratuities to the employing unit. The reasonable cash value of remuneration in a medium other than cash, and the reasonable amount of gratuities, shall be estimated and determined in accordance with regulations adopted by the department; notwithstanding
AS 23.20.350
(a), back pay awards shall be allocated to the weeks or quarters with respect to which the pay was earned. If the remuneration of an individual is not based on a fixed period of time or if the individual's wages are paid in irregular intervals or in a manner that does not extend regularly over the period of employment, the wages shall be allocated to weeks or quarters in accordance with regulations adopted by the department. The regulations must, so far as possible, produce results reasonably similar to those that would prevail if the individual's wages were paid at regular intervals. When an employer has filed for bankruptcy, unpaid wages earned for services performed for the employer are considered wages for the quarter in which they were earned.</p>
