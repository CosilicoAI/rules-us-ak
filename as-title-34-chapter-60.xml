(2) the amount necessary to enable the displaced person to make a down payment, including incidental expenses described in

              <p>Sec. 34.60.110.   Nontaxation of payments.
A payment received by a displaced person under this chapter is not income for the purposes of the state or federal income tax, personal or corporate.  The payments are not income or resources to a recipient of public assistance and the payments may not be deducted from the amount of aid to which the recipient would otherwise be entitled.</p>

            <content>
              <p>Sec. 34.60.120.   Uniform real property acquisition policy.
A state agency or other entity acquiring real property for any project or program in which federal or federal-aid funds are used shall to the greatest extent practicable comply with the following policies:
(1) Every reasonable effort shall be made to expeditiously acquire real property by negotiation.
(2) Real property shall be appraised before the initiation of negotiations, and the owner or a designated representative shall be given an opportunity to accompany the appraiser during the inspection of the property.
(3) Before the initiation of negotiations for real property, an amount shall be established that is reasonably believed to be just compensation for the real property and that amount shall be offered for the property. In no event may the amount be less than the approved appraisal of the fair market value of the property.  A decrease or increase in the fair market value of real property before the date of valuation caused by the public improvement for which the property is acquired or by the likelihood that the property would be acquired for the improvement, other than that due to physical deterioration within the reasonable control of the owner, will be disregarded in determining the compensation for the property. The owner of the real property to be acquired shall be provided with a written statement of, and a summary of the basis for, the amount established as just compensation.
(4) An owner may not be required to surrender possession of real property before the state agency concerned pays the agreed purchase price or deposits with the court in accordance with applicable law, for the benefit of the owner, an amount not less than the approved appraisal of the fair market value of the property, or the amount of the award of compensation in the condemnation proceeding for the property.
(5) The construction or development of a public improvement shall be so scheduled that, to the greatest extent practicable, a person lawfully occupying real property is not required to move from a dwelling, assuming a replacement dwelling will be available, or to move the person's business or farm operation, without at least 90 days' written notice of the date by which the move is required.
(6) If an owner or tenant is permitted to occupy the real property acquired on a rental basis for a short term or for a period subject to termination by the state agency on short notice, the amount of rent required may not exceed the fair rental value of the property to a short-term occupier.
(7) In no event may the time of condemnation be advanced or negotiations or condemnation and the deposit of funds in court for the use of the owner be deferred, nor any other coercive action be taken in order to compel an agreement on the price to be paid for the property.
(8) If an interest in real property is to be acquired by exercise of the power of eminent domain, formal condemnation proceedings shall be instituted.  The acquiring state agency may not intentionally make it necessary for an owner to institute legal proceedings to prove the fact of the taking of the real property.
(9) If the acquisition of only part of the property would leave its owner with an uneconomic remnant, an offer to acquire the entire property shall be made.</p>

                <p>Payment for the buildings, structures, or improvements under this section may not result in duplication of payments otherwise authorized by law.  A payment for buildings, structures, or improvements may not be made unless the owner of the land involved disclaims all interest in the improvements of the tenant.  In consideration for any such payment, the tenant shall assign, transfer, and release to the state agency all right, title, and interest in and to the improvements.  Nothing in this subsection and in (b) of this section deprives the tenant of any rights to reject payment and to obtain payment for the property interests in accordance with other laws of the state.</p>

              <p>Sec. 34.60.135.   Planning loans for additional housing.
In addition to the other programs authorized by this chapter, the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation may make loans in order to encourage and facilitate the construction or rehabilitation of housing to meet the needs of displaced persons. These loans are a part of the federally assisted project cost and may be made to nonprofit, limited dividend, or cooperative organizations, or to public bodies. The loans may be made only for necessary and reasonable expenses, before construction, for planning and obtaining federally insured mortgage financing for the rehabilitation or construction of housing for displaced persons. The loans may not exceed 80 percent of the reasonable costs expected to be incurred in planning, and in obtaining financing for housing for displaced persons. Reasonable costs include but are not limited to costs for preliminary surveys and analysis of market needs, preliminary architectural fees, site acquisition, application and mortgage commitment fees, and construction loan fees and discounts. Loans to an organization established for profit shall bear interest at a market rate established by the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation. All other loans shall be without interest. The Alaska Housing Finance Corporation shall require repayment of loans made under this section under terms and conditions that it may prescribe. Repayment shall be made upon completion of the project or sooner, and except in the case of a loan to an organization established for profit, the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation may cancel any part or all of a loan if the corporation determines that a permanent loan to finance the rehabilitation or construction of the housing cannot be obtained in an amount adequate for repayment of the loan.</p>

              <p>Sec. 34.60.137.   Housing replacement assistance as last resort.
If a federal aided program or project cannot proceed to actual construction because comparable replacement sale or rental housing is not available, and the state agency determines that housing cannot otherwise be made available, the agency may take, or may request the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation to take, action necessary or appropriate to provide the housing either by use of funds authorized for the project or by use of money available to the corporation.</p>
