                <p>A motor vehicle service contract must allow the service contract holder to cancel the motor vehicle service contract not later than 30 days after the date that the motor vehicle service contract was delivered to the service contract holder, not later than 10 days after the date of delivery if the motor vehicle service contract is delivered to the service contract holder at the time of sale, or within a longer period, as set out in the motor vehicle service contract. If the service contract holder returns the motor vehicle service contract to the provider within the applicable time period and a claim has not been made under the motor vehicle service contract before the contract is returned to the provider, the motor vehicle service contract is void, and the provider shall refund the full amount of the provider fee to the service contract holder or credit the account of the service contract holder not later than 45 days after the return of the contract to the provider. If the provider does not pay or credit a refund owed under this subsection not later than 45 days after a service contract holder returns a motor vehicle service contract, a penalty in the amount of 10 percent of the provider fee paid by the service contract holder for each month the refund remains unpaid shall be added to the refund. The right to void the motor vehicle service contract provided in this subsection is not transferable and applies only to the original service contract holder for a contract under which a claim is not made before the contract is returned to the provider.</p>
