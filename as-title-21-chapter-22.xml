If at any time the director determines that any material transaction entered into between an insurer and any of its affiliates does not meet the standards set out in
AS 21.22.080
, the director may, after hearings conducted in accordance with
AS 21.06
, require the insurer and the affiliate to terminate, set aside, or modify the transaction as considered appropriate by the director to make the transaction conform to those standards.  An insurer may submit a proposed material transaction to the director for review and the director may issue an opinion that the transaction meets the standard set out in
AS 21.22.080
.  The opinion creates a rebuttable presumption that neither the insurer, director, officer, employee, nor agent committed a wilful violation of this chapter by entering into the transaction.  The opinion does not prohibit the director from subsequently exercising authority under this section.</p>

              <p>Sec. 21.22.090.   Adequacy of surplus.
For the purposes of this chapter, in determining whether an insurer's surplus as regards policyholders is reasonable in relation to the insurer's outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs, the following factors, among others, shall be considered:
(1) the size of the insurer as measured by its assets, capital and surplus, reserves, premium writings, insurance in force, and other appropriate criteria;
(2) the extent to which the insurer's business is diversified among the several lines of insurance;
(3) the number and size of risks insured in each line of business;
(4) the extent of the geographical dispersion of the insurer's insured risk;
(5) the nature and extent of the insurer's reinsurance program;
(6) the quality, diversification, and liquidity of the insurer's investment portfolio;
(7) the recent past and projected future trend in the value of the insurer's investments;
(8) the surplus as regards policyholders maintained by other comparable insurers;
(9) the adequacy of the insurer's reserves; and
(10) the quality and liquidity of investments in affiliates made under
AS 21.21
; the director may treat any such investment as a disallowed asset for purposes of determining the adequacy of surplus as regards policyholders whenever the director determines the investment warrants it.</p>

                <p>For purposes of this section, an extraordinary dividend or distribution includes a dividend or distribution of cash or other property, the fair market value of which together with that of other dividends or distributions made within the preceding 12 months exceeds the lesser of (1) 10 percent of the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders as of December 31 of the preceding year; or (2) the net gain from operations of the insurer, if the insurer is a life insurer, or the net investment income, if the insurer is not a life insurer, for the 12-month period ending December 31 of the preceding year; but does not include pro rata distributions of any class of the insurer's own securities. In determining whether a dividend or distribution is extraordinary, an insurer other than a life insurer may carry forward net income from the previous two calendar years that has not already been paid out as dividends. The carry forward provision shall be computed by taking the net income from the second and third preceding calendar years, not including realized capital gains, less dividends paid in the second and immediate preceding calendar years.</p>
