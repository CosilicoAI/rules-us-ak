                <p>Without prior hearing, the director may order summary suspension of a license if the director finds that protection of the public requires emergency action and incorporates that finding in an order. The suspension is effective on the date specified in the order or on the date of mailing by first class mail to the licensee's business address on record with the division, whichever is later. If the licensee requests a hearing, the director shall conduct a hearing on the suspension within a reasonable time but not later than 20 days after the effective date of the summary suspension unless the person whose license is suspended requests a later date. At the hearing, the director shall determine if the suspension should be continued or withdrawn and, if proper notice is given, may determine if the license should be revoked. The director shall issue a decision within 30 days after the conclusion of the hearing. If the director decides to continue the suspension or revoke the license, the suspension or revocation must be based on one or more grounds in
AS 21.27.410
. The summary suspension continues until the decision is issued.
AS 21.06.190
