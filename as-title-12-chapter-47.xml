AS 12.47.020
, the defendant or the prosecuting attorney may raise the issue of whether the defendant is guilty but mentally ill. A party that seeks a post-conviction determination of guilty but mentally ill must give notice 10 days before trial of intent to do so; however, this deadline is waived if the opposing party presents evidence or argument at trial tending to show that the defendant may be guilty but mentally ill. A hearing must be held on this issue before the same fact finder that returned the verdict of guilty under procedures set by the court. In cases decided by a jury, at the request of the defendant and with the concurrence of the prosecuting attorney, the court may decide the issue. A waiver of consideration by a jury must be in writing and in person before the court. At the hearing, the fact finder shall determine whether the defendant has been shown to be guilty but mentally ill beyond a reasonable doubt, considering evidence presented at the hearing and any evidence relevant to the issue that was presented at trial.</p>

                <p>If, before imposition of sentence, the prosecuting attorney or the attorney for the defendant has reasonable cause to believe that the defendant is presently suffering from a mental disease or defect that causes the defendant to be unable to understand the proceedings or to assist in the person's own defense, the attorney may file a motion for a judicial determination of the competency of the defendant. Upon that motion, or upon its own motion, the court, if justified by findings of fact and conclusions of law, shall have the defendant examined by at least one qualified psychiatrist or psychologist, who shall report to the court concerning the competency of the defendant. For the purpose of the examination, the court may order the defendant committed for a reasonable period to a suitable hospital or other facility designated by the court. If the report of the psychiatrist or psychologist indicates that the defendant is incompetent, the court shall hold a hearing, upon due notice, at which evidence as to the competency of the defendant may be submitted, including that of the reporting psychiatrist or psychologist, and make appropriate findings. Before the hearing, the court shall, upon request of the prosecuting attorney, order the defendant to submit to an additional evaluation by a psychiatrist or psychologist designated by the prosecuting attorney.</p>
