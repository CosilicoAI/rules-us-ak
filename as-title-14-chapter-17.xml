                <p>To determine the amount of required local contribution under
AS 14.17.410
(b)(2) and to aid the department and the legislature in planning, the Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic Development, in consultation with the assessor for each district in a city or borough, shall determine the full and true value of the taxable real and personal property in each district in a city or borough. If there is no local assessor or current local assessment for a city or borough school district, then the Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic Development shall make the determination of full and true value guided by
AS 29.45.110
and based on a determination of full and true value made by the state assessor at least every two years using the best information available, including on-site inspections made by the state assessor in each of those districts at least once every four years. For purposes of this subsection, the full and true value of taxable real and personal property in any area detached shall be excluded from the determination of the full and true value of the municipality from which the property was detached for the two years immediately preceding the effective date of the detachment. Also, in making the determination for a municipality that is a school district, or for a city that is within a borough school district, the assessed value of property taxable under
AS 43.56
shall be excluded if a tax is not levied under
AS 29.45.080
by the municipality that is the school district. The determination of full and true value shall be made by October 1 and sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, on or before that date to the president of the school board in each city or borough school district. Duplicate copies shall be sent to the commissioner. The governing body of a city or borough that is a school district may obtain judicial review of the determination. The superior court may modify the determination of the Department of Commerce, Community, and</p>
