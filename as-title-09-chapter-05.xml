From the time of the service of a copy of the summons and complaint, or of the completion of the publication when service by publication is ordered, the court acquires jurisdiction and has control of all the subsequent proceedings.  The voluntary appearance of the defendant is equivalent to personal service of a copy of the summons and complaint upon the defendant.</p>
