The governor as ex officio commander of the militia of the state has command of the Alaska National Guard and the Alaska Naval Militia while they are not in active federal service. The governor may adopt necessary regulations for them. The Alaska National Guard and the Alaska Naval Militia and their members are subject to all federal laws and regulations relating to the National Guard and Naval Militia of the several states and territories and of the United States.</p>

            <content>
              <p>Sec. 26.05.070.   Governor may order organized militia into active state service.
In the event of war, disaster, insurrection, rebellion, tumult, catastrophe, wildland fire, invasion, or riot; or if a mob or body of men act together by force with intent to commit a felony or to offer violence to persons or property, or by force and violence to break and resist the laws of the state, or the United States; or in the case of imminent danger of the occurrence of any of these events; or whenever responsible civil authorities fail to preserve law and order, or protect life and property, or the governor believes that failure is imminent, the governor may order the organized militia or any part of it, into active state service to execute the laws and to perform duties in connection with them that the governor considers proper. Whenever any portion of the militia is ordered into active state service by the governor, it becomes an additional police force, retaining its separate entity and operating at all times as a military organization under military command, with power to cooperate with but not to supersede the existing civilian law enforcement officers whenever possible, for the re-establishment of law and order and for the protection of life and property. The governor may also order members of the organized militia to active state service, with their consent, for the purpose of training or for full-time duty with the office of the adjutant general. In the event of wildland fire, the governor may delegate to the adjutant general the governor's authority under this section to order some or all of the organized militia into active state service to fight wildland fire. In this section, wildland fire includes the uncontrolled burning of grass, brush, timber, and other vegetative material.</p>

              <p>Sec. 26.05.365.   Statement of policy on military justice.
Courts-martial have primary jurisdiction over offenses under this chapter, except when an act or omission violates both this chapter and local criminal law, foreign or domestic. In that case, a court-martial may be initiated only after a civilian authority has declined to prosecute or dismissed the charge, provided jeopardy has not attached. Jurisdiction over attempted crimes, conspiracy crimes, solicitation, and accessory crimes must be determined by the underlying offense. These jurisdictional requirements do not apply to nonjudicial punishment or administrative action taken by military authorities.</p>

              <p>Sec. 26.05.915.   Making, drawing, or uttering check, draft, or order without sufficient funds.
A member of the militia who makes, draws, utters, or delivers a check, draft, or order for the payment of money on a bank or other depository, knowing at the time that the maker or drawer has not or will not have sufficient funds in, or credit with, the bank or other depository for the payment of that check, draft, or order in full on its presentment, with intent to defraud for the procurement of any article or thing of value or with intent to deceive for the payment of a past due obligation or for another purpose, may be punished by up to one year of confinement, by separation with characterization up to dishonorable discharge, and by such other punishment as a court-martial may direct. The making, drawing, uttering, or delivering by a maker or drawer of a check, draft, or order, payment of which is refused by the drawee because of insufficient funds of the maker or drawer in the drawee's possession or control, is prima facie evidence of the person's intent to defraud or deceive and of the knowledge of insufficient funds in, or credit with, that bank or other depository, unless the maker or drawer pays the holder the amount due within five days after receiving notice, orally or in writing, that the check, draft, or order was not paid on presentment. In this section, credit means an arrangement or understanding, express or implied, with the bank or other depository for the payment of that check, draft, or order.</p>
