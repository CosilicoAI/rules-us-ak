Before taking office, the commissioner shall furnish a bond to the state.  The bond shall be approved by the attorney general and filed with the Department of Administration, and a copy of it shall be filed in the attorney general's office.  The bond shall be conditioned that the principal will faithfully discharge the duties of the office, keep a strict, true and correct account of all money disbursed, and that the principal will properly account for it and will pay over to a successor or other person entitled by law to receive it all money or property in the hands or possession of the principal, in accordance with law; or, in default, that the parties executing the bond will pay to the state and others injured all damages, costs, and expenses resulting from the default. The surety on the bond shall be a surety company authorized to transact business in the state.  All premiums for the commissioner's bond shall be paid by the state. The amount of the bond shall be $200,000, but if the funds in the treasury of the state exceed the amount of the bond given by the commissioner, or if for any reason the governor and the Department of Administration consider the bond insufficient they shall notify the commissioner of that fact, and the commissioner shall give the additional bond with sufficient sureties, within the time and in the amount that the governor and the Department of Administration consider necessary for the safety of the state.</p>

              <p>Sec. 43.05.245.   Assessment and collection of tax, penalties, and interest.
If a taxpayer fails to file a return or report required by this title in the time required by law or regulation, or makes an erroneous or fraudulent return, the department shall proceed to assess the license fees, tax, penalties, or interest and make a return from information that it obtains. An assessment or a return subscribed by the department in accordance with this section is presumed sufficient for all legal purposes. However, nothing prevents a taxpayer from presenting evidence or other information in an informal conference under
AS 43.05.240
or in an appeal under
AS 43.05.241
in order to rebut the presumed sufficiency of an assessment or return subscribed by the department, nor does the presumption of sufficiency alter the parties' respective burdens of proof once the taxpayer has presented evidence or other material information to rebut that presumption. The assessment of license fees, tax, penalties, or interest under this section occurs when the department issues a notice and demand for payment of the license fees, tax, penalties, or interest. The notice and demand for payment is issued when the notice and demand is delivered to the taxpayer in person or placed in the United States mail, addressed to the last known address of the taxpayer. Penalties and interest assessed under this title shall be collected in the same manner as provided in this title for the collection of tax or license fees.</p>

Oral evidence may be taken only on oath or affirmation.
