            <content>
              <p>Sec. 21.33.011.   Purpose.
The legislature declares that insurance transactions with nonadmitted insurers are so affected with a public interest as to require regulation, taxation, supervision, and control of the transactions and matters relating to nonadmitted insurance as provided in this chapter in order to
(1) protect the insureds and claimants of this state in transactions involving the purchase of insurance from nonadmitted insurers;
(2) avoid the obstacle of resorting to distant forums for the purpose of asserting legal rights under policies issued by nonadmitted insurers;
(3) provide a method of substituted service of process upon nonadmitted insurers for proceedings before the director and in the courts in this state;
(4) provide for the public the ability to self-procure insurance directly from nonadmitted insurers;
(5) protect the revenue of the state;
(6) protect regulated, admitted insurers from unregulated and unfair competition by nonadmitted insurers;
(7) regulate and supervise the effectuation of nonadmitted insurance under the laws of this state and 15 U.S.C. 1011; and
(8) maintain reliable insurance markets.</p>

                <p>The transaction of insurance by an unauthorized person or nonadmitted insurer is equivalent to and constitutes an irrevocable appointment by that person or insurer, binding upon the person or insurer, the executor, administrator, or personal representative of the person or insurer, or its successor in interest if a corporation, of the director and the successors of the director in office to be the lawful attorney of that person or insurer upon whom may be served all legal process in any action, suit, or proceeding in any court arising out of a transaction of insurance in this state or relative to a subject resident, located, or to be performed in this state by that person or nonadmitted insurer, except in an action, suit, or proceeding by the director or by the state. The transaction of insurance by an unauthorized person or nonadmitted insurer is acceptance by that person or insurer that legal process so served has the same legal force and validity as personal service of process in this state upon the person or insurer, or upon the executor, administrator, or personal representative of the person or insurer, or its successor in interest if a corporation.</p>

In an action against an unauthorized person or nonadmitted insurer upon a contract of insurance issued or delivered in this state to a resident or to a corporation authorized to do business in this state, if the person or insurer has failed for 30 days after demand before the commencement of the action to make payment in accordance with the terms of the contract, and it appears to the court that the refusal was vexatious and without reasonable cause, the court may allow to the plaintiff a reasonable attorney fee and include the fee in the judgment that may be rendered in the action.  Failure of the person or insurer to defend the action shall be considered prima facie evidence that its failure to make payment was vexatious and without reasonable cause.</p>
