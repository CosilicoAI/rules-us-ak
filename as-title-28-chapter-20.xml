              <p>Sec. 28.20.010.   Declaration of purpose.
The legislature is concerned over the rising toll of motor vehicle accidents and the suffering and loss inflicted by them.  The legislature determines that it is a matter of grave concern that motorists be financially responsible for their negligent acts so that innocent victims of motor vehicle accidents may be recompensed for the injury and financial loss inflicted upon them.  The legislature finds and declares that the public interest can best be served by the requirements that the operator of a motor vehicle involved in an accident respond for damages and show proof of financial ability to respond for damages in future accidents as a prerequisite to the person's exercise of the privilege of operating a motor vehicle in the state.</p>

              <p>Sec. 28.20.580.   Assigned risk plans.
After consultation with the insurance companies authorized to issue motor vehicle liability policies in this state, the director of the division of insurance shall approve a reasonable plan, fair to the insurers and equitable to their policyholders, for the apportionment among these companies of applicants for motor vehicle policies and other vehicle coverages who are in good faith entitled to but are unable to procure policies through ordinary methods. When a plan is approved, all the insurance companies shall subscribe to it and participate in it, except a reciprocal insurer formed by and only insuring a group of municipalities or nonprofit utilities under
AS 21.75
, or a reciprocal insurer formed under
AS 21.75
to provide marine insurance. An applicant for an assigned risk policy, a person insured under an assigned risk plan, and an insurance company affected may appeal to the commissioner of commerce, community, and economic development from a ruling or decision of the authority designated to operate the plan. Failure to adopt an assigned risk plan does not relieve any person from responsibility under this chapter.</p>
