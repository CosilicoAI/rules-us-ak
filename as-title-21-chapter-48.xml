            <content>
              <p>Sec. 21.48.060.   Debtor groups.
The lives of a group of individuals may be insured under a policy issued to a creditor, who shall be considered the policyholder, to insure the debtors of the creditor, subject to the following requirements:
(1) the debtors eligible for insurance under the policy shall be all of the debtors of the creditor whose indebtedness is repayable either (A) in installments, or (B) in one sum at the end of a period not in excess of 18 months from the initial date of the debt, or all of any class or classes of them determined by conditions pertaining to the indebtedness or the purchase giving rise to the indebtedness; the policy may provide that the term debtors includes the debtors of one or more subsidiary corporations, and the debtors of one or more affiliated corporations, proprietors, or partnerships if the business of the policyholder and of the affiliated corporations, proprietors, or partnerships is under common control;
(2) the premium for the policy shall be paid by the policyholder, either from the creditor's funds or from charges collected from the insured debtors or from both; a policy on which part or all of the premium is to be derived from the collection from the insured debtors of identifiable charges not required of uninsured debtors may not include, in the class or classes of debtors eligible for insurance, debtors under obligations outstanding at its date of issue without evidence of individual insurability unless at least 75 percent of the then eligible debtors elect to pay the required charges; a policy on which no part of the premium is to be derived from the collection of the identifiable charges must insure all eligible debtors, or all except those whose evidence of individual insurability is not satisfactory to the insurer;
(3) the policy may be issued only if the group of eligible debtors is then receiving new entrants at the rate of at least 100 persons yearly, or may reasonably be expected to receive at least 100 new entrants during the first policy year, and only if the policy reserves to the insurer the right to require evidence of individual insurability if less than 75 percent of the new entrants become insured; the policy may exclude from the classes eligible for insurance classes of debtors determined by age;
(4) the amount of insurance on the life of a debtor may at no time exceed the amount owed by the debtor to the creditor; if the insurance is in connection with an educational credit transaction commitment, the amount owed by the debtor to the creditor may be considered to include the portion of the educational loan commitment that has not been advanced by the creditor; if the indebtedness is repayable in one sum to the creditor, the insurance on the life of a debtor may in no instance be in effect for a period in excess of 18 months, except that the insurance may be continued for an additional period not exceeding six months in the case of default, extension, or recasting of the loan;
(5) the insurance shall be payable to the policyholder; each payment shall reduce or extinguish the unpaid indebtedness of the debtor to the extent of the payment.</p>

              <p>Sec. 21.48.070.   Credit union group.
The lives of a group of individuals may be insured under a policy issued to a credit union organized under the laws of the state or the Federal Credit Union Act, which shall be considered the policyholder, to insure eligible members for amounts of insurance not in excess of the share balance of each member, based upon some plan that will preclude individual selection, for the benefit of someone other than the credit union or its officials and subject to the following requirements:
(1) the members eligible for insurance under the policy shall be all the members of the credit union who meet standard physical requirement conditions of the insurer, or all of any class or classes of them determined by conditions pertaining to their age, or to membership in the credit union, or both;
(2) the premiums for the policy shall be paid by the policyholder, either wholly from the credit union's funds, or partly from these funds and partly from funds contributed by the insured members specifically for their insurance; a policy may not be issued on which the entire premium is to be derived from funds contributed by the insured members specifically for their insurance; a policy on which part of the premium is to be derived from funds contributed by the insured members specifically for their insurance may be placed only if at least 75 percent of the then eligible members, excluding those whose evidence of individual insurability is not satisfactory to the insured, elect to make the required contribution; a policy on which no part of the premium is to be derived from funds contributed by the insured members specifically for their insurance must insure all eligible members or all except those whose evidence of individual insurability is not satisfactory to the insurer;
(3) the policy must cover at least 25 members at the date of issue.</p>

AS 21.48.160
 21.48.200 do not apply to policies issued to a creditor to insure debtors of the creditor;
(2) the standard provisions required for individual life insurance policies do not apply to group life insurance policies;
(3) if the group life insurance policy is on a plan of insurance other than the term plan, it must contain a nonforfeiture provision or provisions that in the opinion of the director is or are equitable to the insured persons and to the policyholder, but nothing in this paragraph may be construed to require that group life insurance policies contain the same nonforfeiture provisions as are required for individual life insurance policies.</p>

(1) the individual policy shall, at the option of the person, be on any one of the forms, except term insurance, then customarily issued by the insurer at the age and for the amount applied for;
(2) the amount of the individual policy may not be in excess of the amount of life insurance that ceases because of the termination, less the amount of any life insurance for which the person is or becomes eligible under the same or any other group policy within 31 days after the termination, provided that any amount of insurance that matured on or before the date of the termination as an endowment payable to the person insured, whether in one sum or in installments or in the form of annuity, may not, for the purpose of this provision, be included in the amount that is considered to cease because of the termination;
(3) the premium on the individual policy shall be at the insurer's then customary rate applicable to the form and amount of the individual policy, to the class of risk to which the person then belongs, and to the person's age attained on the effective date of the individual policy.</p>

The group life insurance policy must contain a provision that if a person insured under the policy dies during the period within which the person would have been entitled to have an individual policy issued in accordance with
AS 21.48.180
or 21.48.190 and before the individual policy becomes effective, the amount of life insurance that the person would have been entitled to have issued under the individual policy shall be payable as a claim under the group policy, whether or not application for the individual policy or the payment of the first premium has been made.</p>

              <p>Sec. 21.48.210.   Notice as to conversion right.
If an individual insured under a group life insurance policy hereafter delivered in this state becomes entitled under the terms of the policy to have an individual policy of life insurance issued without evidence of insurability, subject to making application and paying the first premium within the period specified in the policy, and if the individual is not given notice of the existence of the right at least 15 days before the expiration date of the period, the individual shall have an additional period within which to exercise the right, but nothing in this section may be construed to continue an insurance beyond the period provided in the policy.  This additional period shall expire 15 days after the individual is given notice, but in no event may the additional period extend beyond 60 days after the expiration date of the period provided in the policy. Written notice presented to the individual or mailed by the policyholder to the last known address of the individual or mailed by the insurer to the last known address of the individual as furnished by the policyholder constitutes notice for the purpose of this section.</p>
