AS 36.90.240
has been previously furnished to the subcontractor and a copy of the notice is furnished to the contracting officer of the state or political subdivision.</p>

                <p>A provision that reads substantially as follows satisfies the requirement of (a) of this section:
The consultant shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the contracting agency from and against any claim of, or liability for, negligent acts, errors, and omissions of the consultant under this agreement. The consultant is not required to indemnify, defend, or hold harmless the contracting agency for a claim of, or liability for, the independent negligent acts, errors, and omissions of the contracting agency. If there is a claim of, or liability for, a joint negligent act, error, or omission of the consultant and the contracting agency, the indemnification, defense, and hold harmless obligation of this provision shall be apportioned on a comparative fault basis. In this provision, consultant and contracting agency include the employees, agents, and contractors who are directly responsible, respectively, to each. In this provision, independent negligent acts, errors, and omissions means negligence other than in the contracting agency's selection, administration, monitoring, or controlling of the consultant, or in approving or accepting the consultant's work.</p>
