                <p>The legislature may make appropriations from a municipality's individual grant account established under (b) of this section to the municipality for capital projects under this section. Subject to appropriations under this subsection and to the local share requirements of
AS 37.06.030
, each municipality may draw amounts from its individual grant account for a capital project, in accordance with an appropriation for that project. In accepting a draw, the municipality covenants with the state that it will provide for the operation and maintenance of the capital project for which the draw is used for the practical life of the project, and acknowledges that the state is not responsible for operating or maintaining the capital project or for paying for its operation or maintenance. This requirement does not apply to use of money from a draw for repair or improvement of an existing facility that is operated or maintained by the state at the time that the draw is made if the repair or improvement for which the draw is used will not substantially increase the operating or maintenance costs to the state. No more than 10 percent of the total amount of money from a draw for land acquisition, or planning, design, construction, or repair of a facility may be used for administrative expenses. No more than five percent of the total amount of money from a draw for equipment or equipment repairs may be used for administrative expenses. If a municipality provides grant money from a draw to another recipient, the municipality may not use any of the money from the draw for administrative expenses. The municipality and its agents, contractors, and subcontractors shall comply with the hiring preferences under
AS 36.10
in hiring employees to be paid wholly or in part with money from a draw.</p>
