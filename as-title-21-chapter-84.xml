However, a society may not indemnify or reimburse a person in connection with a matter in an action, suit, or proceeding, or threat of an action, suit, or proceeding, that has been made the subject of a compromise settlement, or in which the person is adjudged to be guilty of breach of a duty as a director, officer, employee, or agent of the society, unless the person acted in good faith for a purpose the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the society, and, in a criminal action or proceeding, in addition, had no reasonable cause to believe that the person's conduct constituted a violation of a criminal law of this state or another jurisdiction. The determination of whether the conduct of the person meets the standard required to justify indemnification and reimbursement may be made by the supreme governing body or the board of directors through a majority vote of a quorum consisting of persons who were not parties to the action, suit, or proceeding or by a court of competent jurisdiction. The termination of an action, suit, or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or plea of no contest as to the person does not in itself create a conclusive presumption that the person did not meet the standard of conduct required to justify indemnification and reimbursement.

Upon receipt of a preliminary certificate of authority from the director, the domestic society may solicit members for the purpose of completing its organization, shall collect from each applicant the amount of not less than one regular monthly premium in accordance with its table of rates, and shall issue to each applicant a receipt for the amount collected. A domestic society may not incur any liability other than for the return of the advance premium, or issue any certificate, or pay, allow, or offer or promise to pay or allow, a death or health care benefit to any person until
(1) actual bona fide applications for benefits have been secured on 500 applicants and any necessary evidence of insurability has been furnished to and approved by the society;
(2) certificates of examinations or acceptable declarations of insurability have been filed and approved by the chief medical examiner of the society;
(3) 10 subordinate lodges or branches have been established into which the 500 applicants have been admitted;
(4) there has been submitted to the director, under oath of the president or secretary, or corresponding officer of the society, a list of the applicants, giving their names, addresses, date each was admitted, name and number of the subordinate branch of which each applicant is a member, amount of benefits to be granted, and premiums for them;
(5) it has been shown to the director, by sworn statement of the treasurer, or corresponding officer of the society, that at least 500 applicants have each paid in cash at least one regular monthly premium, which premiums in the aggregate shall amount to at least $150,000; the advance premiums shall be held in trust during the period of organization, and, if the society has not qualified for a certificate of authority within one year, the premiums shall be returned to the applicants.</p>

The certificate, together with any riders or endorsements attached to it, the laws of the society, the application for membership, the application for insurance, and the declaration of insurability, if any, signed by the applicant, and all amendments to each constitute the benefit contract, as of the date of issuance, between the society and the owner, and the certificate must so state. A copy of the application for insurance and declaration of insurability, if any, shall be endorsed upon or attached to the certificate. All statements on the application shall be representations and not warranties. A waiver of this provision is void.</p>

A filing is considered approved unless disapproved within 60 days after the date of filing.

The certificate must also contain a provision stating the amount of premiums that are payable under the certificate and a provision reciting or setting out the substance of sections of the society's laws or rules in force at the time of issuance of the certificate that, if violated, will result in the termination or reduction of benefits payable under the certificate. If the laws of the society provide for expulsion or suspension of a member, the certificate must also contain a provision that any member expelled or suspended, except for nonpayment of a premium or within the contestable period for material misrepresentation in the application for membership or insurance, is entitled to maintain the certificate in force by continuing payment of the required premium.</p>
