              <p>Sec. 47.12.140.   Court dispositional order.
In making its dispositional order under
AS 47.12.120
(b)(1)  (3) and (5) and (j), the court shall
(1) consider both the best interests of the minor and the interests of the public, and, in doing so, the court shall take into account
(A) the seriousness of the minor's delinquent act and the attitude of the minor and the minor's parents toward that act;
(B) the minor's culpability as indicated by the circumstances of the particular case;
(C) the age of the minor;
(D) the minor's prior criminal or juvenile record and the success or failure of any previous orders, dispositions, or placements imposed on the minor;
(E) the effect of the dispositional order to be imposed in deterring the minor from committing other delinquent acts;
(F) the need to commit the minor to the department's custody or to detain the minor in a juvenile treatment facility, juvenile detention facility, secure residential psychiatric treatment center, or other suitable place in order to prevent further harm to the public;
(G) the interest of the public in securing the minor's rehabilitation; and
(H) the ability of the state to take custody of and to care for the minor; and
(2) order the least restrictive alternative disposition for the minor; for purposes of this paragraph, the least restrictive alternative disposition means that disposition that is no more restrictive than is, in the judgment of the court, most conducive to the minor's rehabilitation taking into consideration the interests of the public.</p>

                <p>When a minor is committed to the department under
AS 47.12.120
(b)(1) or (3) or 47.12.240, detained by the department on behalf of the Department of Corrections under
AS 33.30.011
and
AS 47.12.105
, or released under
AS 47.12.120
(b)(2) to the minor's parents, guardian, or other suitable person, a relationship of legal custody exists. This relationship imposes on the state and its authorized agents or the parents, guardian, or other suitable person the responsibility of physical care and control of the minor, the determination of where and with whom the minor shall live, the right and duty to protect, train, and discipline the minor, and the duty of providing the minor with food, shelter, education, and medical care. These obligations are subject to any residual parental rights and responsibilities and rights and responsibilities of a guardian if one has been appointed. When a minor is committed to the department and the department places the minor with the minor's parent, the parent has the responsibility to provide and pay for food, shelter, education, and medical care for the minor. When parental rights have been terminated, or there are no living parents and a guardian has not been appointed, the responsibilities of legal custody include those in (b) and (c) of this section. The department or person having legal custody of the minor may delegate any of the responsibilities under this section, except authority to consent to marriage, adoption, and military enlistment may not be delegated. For purposes of this chapter, a person in charge of a placement setting is an agent of the department.</p>

                <p>An order by the court under
AS 47.12.120
that a minor or the minor's parent pay restitution is a civil judgment that remains enforceable after the expiration of the court's jurisdiction over the minor under
AS 47.12.160
. A recipient of a restitution order, or the state on behalf of the restitution recipient, may enforce a restitution order against the minor and the minor's parent by any procedure authorized by law for enforcement of a civil judgment. If the restitution recipient enforces or collects restitution through civil process, collection costs and full reasonable attorney fees shall be awarded. If the state on the restitution recipient's behalf enforces or collects restitution through civil process, collection costs and full reasonable attorney fees shall be awarded, up to a maximum of twice the amount of restitution owing at the time the civil process was initiated. This section does not limit the authority of the court to otherwise enforce orders of payment for restitution. An order of restitution enforced under this section does not limit under other law the civil liability of the minor or the minor's parent as a result of the delinquent conduct.</p>

When, in the course of a proceeding under this chapter, it appears to the court that the welfare of a minor will be promoted by the appointment of a guardian or custodian of the minor's person or property, the court may make the appointment. The court shall have a summons issued and served upon the parents of the minor, if they can be found, in a manner and within a time before the hearing that the court considers reasonable. The court may determine whether the father, mother, or the department shall have the custody and control of the minor. If the minor is of sufficient age and intelligence to state desires, the court shall consider them. The court may order either or both parents to pay support for the minor's care to the guardian, custodian, or department.</p>
