The following rules apply in an action on a certificated security against the issuer:
(1) unless specifically denied in the pleadings, each signature on a security certificate or in a necessary endorsement is admitted;
(2) if the effectiveness of a signature is put in issue, the burden of establishing effectiveness is on the party claiming under the signature, but the signature is presumed to be genuine or authorized;
(3) if signatures on a security certificate are admitted or established, production of the certificate entitles a holder to recover on it unless the defendant establishes a defense or a defect going to the validity of the security;
(4) if it is shown that a defense or defect exists, the plaintiff has the burden of establishing that the plaintiff or some person under whom the plaintiff claims is a person against whom the defense or defect cannot be asserted.</p>

(1) took the action after it had been served with an injunction, restraining order, or other legal process enjoining it from doing so, issued by a court of competent jurisdiction, and had a reasonable opportunity to act on the injunction, restraining order, or other legal process;
(2) acted in collusion with the wrongdoer in violating the rights of the adverse claimant; or

            <content>
              <p>Sec. 45.08.204.   Effect of issuer's restriction on transfer.
A restriction on transfer of a security imposed by the issuer, even though otherwise lawful, is ineffective against a person without knowledge of the restriction unless the security
(1) is certificated and the restriction is noted conspicuously on the security certificate; or
(2) is uncertificated and the registered owner has been notified of the restriction.</p>

              <p>Sec. 45.08.205.   Effect of unauthorized signature on security certificate.
An unauthorized signature placed on a security certificate before or in the course of issue is ineffective, but the signature is effective in favor of a purchaser for value of the certificated security if the purchaser is without notice of the lack of authority and the signing has been done by
(1) an authenticating trustee, registrar, transfer agent, or other person entrusted by the issuer with the signing of the security certificate or of similar security certificates, or the immediate preparation for signing of any of them; or
(2) an employee of the issuer, or of a person listed in (1) of this section, entrusted with responsible handling of the security certificate.</p>
