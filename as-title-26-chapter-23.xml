                <p>If the governor finds that a disaster has occurred or that a disaster is imminent or threatened, the governor shall, by proclamation, declare a condition of disaster emergency. The disaster emergency remains in effect until the governor finds that the danger has passed or the disaster has been dealt with so that the emergency no longer exists. The governor may terminate the disaster emergency by proclamation. A proclamation of disaster emergency may not remain in effect longer than 30 days unless extended by the legislature by a concurrent resolution. The proclamation must indicate the nature of the disaster, the area threatened or affected, and the conditions that have brought it about or that make possible the termination of the disaster emergency. A proclamation to declare a condition of disaster emergency must also state whether the governor proposes to expend state funds to respond to the disaster under (i) or (j) of this section.</p>

Whenever, at the request of the governor, the President has declared a major disaster to exist in this state, the governor may
(1) upon the governor's determination that a political subdivision of the state will suffer a substantial loss of tax and other revenue from the disaster and has demonstrated a need for financial assistance to perform its governmental functions, apply to the federal government, on behalf of the political subdivision, for a loan; the governor may receive and disburse the proceeds of any approved loan to any applicant political subdivision;
(2) determine the amount needed by any applicant political subdivision to restore or resume its governmental functions, and to certify the amount to the federal government;
(3) recommend to the federal government, based upon review by the governor, the cancellation of all or any part of repayment when, for the first three full fiscal years following the major disaster, the revenue of the political subdivision is insufficient to meet its operating expenses, including additional disaster-related expenses of a municipal operation character.</p>
