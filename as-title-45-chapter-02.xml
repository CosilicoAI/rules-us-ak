Warranties whether express or implied shall be construed as consistent with each other and as cumulative, but if that construction is unreasonable the intention of the parties determines which warranty is dominant.  In ascertaining that intention the following rules apply:
(1) exact or technical specifications displace an inconsistent sample or model or general language of description;
(2) a sample from an existing bulk displaces inconsistent general language of description;
(3) an express warranty displaces an inconsistent implied warranty other than an implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose.</p>

Under a contract containing a term C.I.F. or C. &amp; F.,
(1) if the price is based on or is to be adjusted according to net landed weights, delivered weights, out turn quantity or quality, or the like, unless otherwise agreed, the seller must reasonably estimate the price; the payment due on tender of the documents called for by the contract is the amount so estimated, but after final adjustment of the price a settlement must be made with commercial promptness;
(2) an agreement described in (1) of this section, or a warranty of quality or condition of the goods on arrival places upon the seller the risk of ordinary deterioration, shrinkage, and the like in transportation, but has no effect on the place or time of identification to the contract for sale or delivery or on the passing of the risk of loss;
(3) unless otherwise agreed, if the contract provides for payment on or after arrival of the goods, the seller must before payment allow such preliminary inspection as is feasible; but if the goods are lost, delivery of the documents and payment are due when the goods should have arrived.</p>

            <content>
              <p>Sec. 45.02.401.   Passing of title; reservation for security; limited application of this section.
Each provision of this chapter with regard to the rights, obligations, and remedies of the seller, the buyer, purchasers, or other third parties applies irrespective of title to the goods except where the provision refers to the title. Insofar as situations are not covered by the other provisions of this chapter and matters concerning title become material, the following rules apply:
(1) title to goods cannot pass under a contract for sale before their identification to the contract (
AS 45.02.501
), and, unless otherwise explicitly agreed, the buyer acquires by their identification a special property as limited by the code; a retention or reservation by the seller of the title (property) in goods shipped or delivered to the buyer is limited in effect to a reservation of a security interest; subject to these provisions and to the provisions of
AS 45.29
, title to goods passes from the seller to the buyer in the manner and on the conditions explicitly agreed on by the parties;
(2) unless otherwise explicitly agreed, title passes to the buyer at the time and place at which the seller completes performance with reference to the physical delivery of the goods, despite a reservation of a security interest and even though a document of title is to be delivered at a different time or place; in particular and despite a reservation of a security interest by the bill of lading,
(A) if the contract requires or authorizes the seller to send the goods to the buyer but does not require the seller to deliver them at destination, title passes to the buyer at the time and place of shipment; but
(B) if the contract requires delivery at destination, title passes on tender there;
(3) unless otherwise explicitly agreed, where delivery is to be made without moving the goods,
(A) if the seller is to deliver a tangible document of title, title passes at the time and place the seller delivers the document, and, if the seller is to deliver an electronic document of title, title passes when the seller delivers the document; or
(B) if the goods are, at the time of contracting, already identified and no documents of title are to be delivered, title passes at the time and place of contracting;
(4) a rejection or other refusal by the buyer to receive or retain the goods, whether or not justified, or a justified revocation of acceptance revests title to the goods in the seller; this revesting occurs by operation of law and is not a sale.</p>

When either party repudiates the contract with respect to a performance not yet due, the loss of which will substantially impair the value of the contract to the other, the aggrieved party may

(2) resort to any remedy for breach (

(3) in either case suspend the aggrieved party's own performance or proceed in accordance with the provisions of this chapter on the seller's right to identify goods to the contract notwithstanding breach or to salvage unfinished goods (

Except so far as a seller may have assumed a greater obligation and subject to the preceding section on substituted performance,
(1) delay in delivery or nondelivery in whole or in part by a seller who complies with (2) and (3) of this section is not a breach of the seller's duty under a contract for sale if performance as agreed has been made impracticable by the occurrence of a contingency, the nonoccurrence of which was a basic assumption on which the contract was made or by compliance in good faith with an applicable foreign or domestic governmental regulation or order whether or not it later proves to be invalid;
(2) if the causes mentioned in (1) of this section affect only a part of the seller's capacity to perform, the seller must allocate production and deliveries among the seller's customers, but may at the seller's option include regular customers not then under contract as well as the seller's own requirements for further manufacture; the seller may so allocate in a manner that is fair and reasonable;
(3) the seller must notify the buyer seasonably that there will be delay or nondelivery and, when allocation is required under (2) of this section, of the estimated quota thus made available for the buyer.</p>

              <p>Sec. 45.02.722.   Who can sue third parties for injury to goods.
If a third party so deals with goods that have been identified to a contract for sale as to cause actionable injury to a party to that contract,
(1) a right of action against the third party is in either party to the contract for sale who has title to or a security interest or a special property or an insurable interest in the goods; and, if the goods have been destroyed or converted, a right of action is also in the party who either bore the risk of loss under the contract for sale or has since the injury assumed that risk as against the other;
(2) if at the time of the injury the party plaintiff did not fear the risk of loss as against the other party to the contract for sale and there is no arrangement between them for disposition of the recovery, the party plaintiff's suit or settlement is, subject to the party's own interest, as a fiduciary for the other party to the contract;
(3) either party may with the consent of the other sue for the benefit of whom it may concern.</p>
